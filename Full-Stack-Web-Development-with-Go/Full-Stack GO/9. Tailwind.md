# Tailwind, Middleware, and CORS

In this chapter, we will build on the frontend principles we introduced previously by introducing Tailwind CSS, explore how we can consume our backend services via an API from our frontend app, see how we can leverage middleware to transform our JSON requests, and look at how we can provide a secure **Single-Page App** (**SPA**) with a user login.

In this chapter, we’ll cover the following topics:

-   Creating and designing frontend applications using the Tailwind CSS framework
-   Getting an understanding of how to use the Vite CLI to create new Vue applications
-   Configuring our Go service for CORS
-   Setting up a JavaScript Axios library
-   Creating middleware to manage JSON formatting between the frontend and the backend

# Introducing Tailwind

In the previous chapter, we looked at a number of different frontend frameworks to help us go faster, but we’ve been ignoring an elephant in the room of a modern web ecosystem – Tailwind CSS.

Frameworks such as Buefy and Vuetify have a major disadvantage. Due to increasing demand for more and more features, growth, and usage, they became a victim of their own success and ended up too big, giving us less control over our component styles.

Learning about frameworks such as Buefy has become increasingly challenging. Developers have to learn about hundreds of classes and components and then potentially rebuild them just for small style tweaks that were simply not envisioned by the upstream community.

Tailwind is a CSS framework that, unlike other frameworks, does not come prebuilt with classes to add to HTML tags. Instead, it uses a different approach. It brings a much lower level of control by removing ALL default styling from the stylesheet and using utility-based classes to compose and build your app. These utility-based classes provide ways to directly manipulate certain CSS attributes individually, such as text size, margins, spacing, padding, and colors, as well as behavior for mobile, desktop, and other viewports. By applying different tailwind modifiers, we have granular control over the final appearance of an element while ensuring consistent styling and an easy escape route if we need to build slight variations. This really helps in building our Vue components.

Figure 9.1: A button sample

A quick example of creating a blue button can be seen with the following:

```markup
<button type="button" class="
 inline-block px-6 py-2.5 bg-blue-600
 text-white font-medium text-lg leading-tight
 rounded shadow-md
 hover:bg-blue-700 hover:shadow-lg
 focus:bg-blue-700 focus:shadow-lg
 focus:outline-none focus:ring-0
 active:bg-blue-800 active:shadow-lg
 transition duration-150 ease-in-out
">Button</button>
```

You may be saying to yourself, “Wow, that’s a lot of CSS for a button,” but when you consider how Vue helps us build reusable **Single-File Components** (**SFCs**), we would only need to style this once, and all of our components would share that same utility-based CSS approach – whether it’s a `button`, `link`, `image`, `div`, or `paragraph`. You can check the official docs at [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) to dive further into the concepts behind “utility-first” CSS and what the individual classes do.

## Creating a new Tailwind and Vite project

To create our project, we’re going to first generate it with the `Vite CLI`. This will give us the familiar “`Hello World`” output you see here:

![Figure 9.2: Hello World web output](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_9.02_B18295.jpg)

Figure 9.2: Hello World web output

Let’s create a new Vue project with Vite using the following command:

```markup
npm create vite@latest
```

For each of the questions asked, enter the information shown here:

```markup
✔ Project name: … vue-frontend
✔ Select a framework: › vue
✔ Select a variant: › vue
Scaffolding project in /Users/.../vue-frontend...
Done. Now run:
  cd vue-frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
> vue-frontend@0.0.0 dev
> vite
  vite v2.9.12 dev server running at:
  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose
  ready in 332ms.
```

Going to `http://localhost:3000` will now show the screenshot from _Figure 9__.2_. Our project is enabled with “hot reload” or “live reload” so as you change the project code, you will be able to see the design in the browser update when you save the file.

Previous versions of Tailwind CSS had a bit of a reputation for generating large stylesheets (between 3 and 15 MB!) and slowing down build times.

At the end of the Tailwind CSS version 2 era, the team introduced a new **Just-In-Time** (**JIT**) compiler that automatically generates only the necessary CSS required to style your design. This was originally available as an optional plugin but brought massive improvements by reducing bloat, and with JIT, the CSS in development is the same as your final code, which meant no post-processing of the CSS is required for your final builds. Since Tailwind CSS version 3 and above, the JIT compiler has been enabled by default when we install Tailwind CSS, so we don’t have to worry about altering anything in our config file other than what is needed to lay out our project.

We’re going to now add Tailwind CSS to our project and make some changes to the default Vue `Hello World` output provided by the scaffolding from both the Vue and Tailwind packages:

```markup
$ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
$ npx tailwindcss init -p
Created Tailwind CSS config file: tailwind.config.js
Created PostCSS config file: postcss.config.js
$ cat << EOF > tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{vue,js}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
EOF
$ cat << EOF > ./src/tailwind.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
EOF
$ cat << EOF > ./src/main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import './tailwind.css'
createApp(App).mount('#app')
EOF
```

The directives beginning with `@tailwind` in the `tailwind.css` file are part of how we tell the JIT compiler what to apply to generate the CSS – we will only leverage the base, component and utility directives and refer you to the Tailwind CSS official docs for more on this – [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives).

We can now open up our `HelloWorld.vue` file and replace the contents with the following to create our button. The cool part with our dev server still running is that you should be able to see the changes in real time if you save your file as you manipulate the `button` classes:

```markup
<template>
  <div class="flex space-x-2 justify-center">
    <button
      @click="count++"
      type="button"
      class="inline-block px-6 py-2.5 bg-blue-600
             text-white font-medium text-lg leading-tight
             normal-case rounded shadow-md hover:bg-blue-
             700 hover:shadow-lg focus:bg-blue-700
             focus:shadow-lg focus:outline-none
             focus:ring-0 active:bg-blue-800
             active:shadow-lg transition duration-150
             ease-in-out"
    >
      Click me - my count is {{ count }}
    </button>
  </div>
</template>
```

You should end up with something like this:

![Figure 9.3: The Click me button](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_9.03_B18295.jpg)

Figure 9.3: The Click me button

Congratulations! You’ve created your first Tailwind and Vite project. You can see the complete example inside the `chapter9/tailwind-vite-demo` folder.

In the next section, we will look at how to use the API that we developed in Golang from our frontend.

Bookmark

# Consuming your Golang APIs

We’re going to build on our previous frontend example to add some functions to `GET` and `POST` from a simple backend service. The source code can be found inside the `chapter9/backend` folder; it focuses on two simplified functions that do little more than return a fixed string for `GET` and a reversed string based on the `POST` request that we sent.

The `appGET()` function provides the functionality to perform a `GET` operation, while the `appPOST()` function provides it for a `POST` operation:

```markup
func appGET() http.HandlerFunc {
    type ResponseBody struct {
        Message string
    }
    return func(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
        log.Println("GET", req)
        json.NewEncoder(rw).Encode(ResponseBody{
            Message: "Hello World",
        })
    }
}
func appPOST() http.HandlerFunc {
    type RequestBody struct {
        Inbound string
    }
    type ResponseBody struct {
        OutBound string
    }
    return func(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
        log.Println("POST", req)
        var rb RequestBody
        if err := json.NewDecoder(req.Body).Decode(&rb);
                  err != nil {
            log.Println("apiAdminPatchUser: Decode
                         failed:", err)
            rw.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
            return
        }
        log.Println("We received an inbound value of",
                     rb.Inbound)
        json.NewEncoder(rw).Encode(ResponseBody{
            OutBound: stringutil.Reverse(rb.Inbound),
        })
    }
}
```

We’ll start our service by using `go run server.go`, with a view to consuming this data from our frontend application.

We’re going to create two utility functions in our frontend app to allow us to interact with our frontend app, and we’re going to be building these on top of Axios. Axios is a Promise-based HTTP client for the browser that abstracts all the browser-specific code needed to interact with backend services and does an incredible job in providing a single interface for web requests across all browsers , which you can read more about at the official docs here: [https://axios-http.com/](https://axios-http.com/).

We’re going to first install `axios`, then set up our Axios instance, and then we can layer on functionality:

```markup
$ npm install axios
```

With `axios` installed, you’ll now want to create a `lib/api.js` file containing the following:

```markup
import axios from 'axios';
// Create our "axios" object and export
// to the general namespace. This lets us call it as
// api.post(), api.get() etc
export default axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_API_URL,
  withCredentials: true,
});
```

There’s a couple of interesting things to note here; the first is the `baseURL` value, and the second is `withCredentials`.

The `baseURL` value is what Axios uses to build all subsequent requests on top of. If we called `axios.Patch('/foo')` with a `baseURL` value of [https://www.imaginedevops.io/](https://www.imaginedevops.io/), it would perform a `PATCH` call to [https://www.imaginedevops.io/foo](https://www.imaginedevops.io/foo). This is a great way to switch between development and production and ensure you reduce typos.

But what are we doing with `import.meta.env`? This is partly how Vite imports and exposes environment variables. We’re going to add our `VITE_BASE_API_URL` to a `.env` file situated at the base of our project containing the following:

```markup
VITE_BASE_API_URL="http://0.0.0.0:8000"
```

Combined with this and our new `lib/api.js` file, we can now call `axios.Put('/test')` from our code, and by default, it will reference http://0.0.0.0:8000/test. You can see more about how Vite handles environment variables and more at [https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html).

The other part to note is the `withCredentials` property. This value indicates whether or not cross-site access control requests should be made using credentials such as cookies and authorization headers.

The reason we want this property is that we want all our cookie settings to be consistent, but we’ll need to ensure our backend app understands it, which we’ll cover shortly. Setting `withCredentials` has no effect on same-site requests.

Now that we’ve used this to instantiate our `axios` instance, we can leverage this by creating our own `api/demo.js` file inside our frontend application’s `src` folder. It’s not a very original name but it works for us:

```markup
import api from '@/lib/api';
export function getFromServer() {
    return api.get(`/`);
}
export function postToServer(data) {
    return api.post(`/`, data );
}
```

This code exports two functions called `getFromServer` and `postToServer`, with an additional `data` parameter being sent as the `POST` body on the latter function.

A neat trick here is the usage of the `@` import – this is common in a lot of setups to allow us to quickly specify the base path for our code to keep things clean and remove relative/absolute pathing with lots of `../..` referenced everywhere. If you forget this, you’ll see errors such as this:

```markup
12:23:46 [vite] Internal server error: Failed to resolve import "@/api/demo" from "src/components/HelloWorld.vue". Does the file exist?
  Plugin: vite:import-analysis
  File: /Users/nickglynn/Projects/Becoming-a-Full-Stack-Go-
        Developer/chapter 9/frontend/src/components/
        HelloWorld.vue
  1  |  import { ref } from 'vue';
  2  |  import * as demoAPI from '@/api/demo';
     |                            ^
  3  |
  4  |  // Sample to show how we can inspect mode
```

Not great! To fix this, open up your `vite.config.js` file and replace the contents with the following:

```markup
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import path from 'path';
// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  // Add the '@' resolver
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
    },
  },
})
```

I’ve bolded the key parts that we’re adding. We’re telling Vite to use the `@` symbol as an alias so that when we use `@` in a path, it calls `path.resolve()` to resolve the path segments into an absolute path.

With all of this now set up, we’re going to open up our `HelloWorld.vue` and update it, the goal being to create something that looks like _Figure 9__.4_

![Figure 9.4: The UI for GET and POST](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_9.04_B18295.jpg)

Figure 9.4: The UI for GET and POST

Here is the full code for `HelloWorld.vue`:

```markup
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import * as demoAPI from '@/api/demo';
// Sample to show how we can inspect mode
// and import env variables
const deploymentMode = import.meta.env.MODE;
const myBaseURL = import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_API_URL;
async function getData() {
  const { data } = await demoAPI.getFromServer()
  result.value.push(data.Message)
}
async function postData() {
  const { data } = await demoAPI.postToServer({ Inbound: msg.     value })
  result.value.push(data.OutBound)
}
const result = ref([])
const msg = ref("")
defineProps({
  sampleProp: String,
});
</script>
<template>
  <div class="flex space-2 justify-center">
    <button
      @click="getData()"
      type="button"
      class="inline-block px-6 py-2.5 bg-blue-600
             text-white font-medium text-lg leading-tight
             normal-case rounded shadow-md hover:bg-blue-
             700 hover:shadow-lg focus:bg-blue-700
             focus:shadow-lg focus:outline-none
             focus:ring-0 active:bg-blue-800
             active:shadow-lg transition              duration-150 ease-in-out"
    >
      Click to Get
    </button>
  </div>
  <div class="flex mt-4 space-2 justify-center">
    <input type="text"
      class="inline-block px-6 py-2.5 text-blue-600
             font-medium text-lg leading-tight
             rounded shadow-md border-2 border-solid
             border-black focus:shadow-lg  focus:ring-1 "
      v-model="msg" />
    <button
      @click="postData()"
      type="button"
      class="inline-block px-6 py-2.5 bg-blue-600
             text-white font-medium text-lg leading-tight
             normal-case rounded shadow-md hover:bg-blue-
             700 hover:shadow-lg focus:bg-blue-700
             focus:shadow-lg focus:outline-none
             focus:ring-0 active:bg-blue-800
             active:shadow-lg transition
             duration-150 ease-in-out"
    >
      Click to Post
    </button>
  </div>
  <p>You are in {{ deploymentMode }} mode</p>
  <p>Your API is at {{ myBaseURL }}</p>
  <li v-for="(r, index) in result">
    {{ r }}
  </li>
</template>
<style scoped></style>
```

The parts in bold are the most interesting parts. These show how we can use `GET` and `POST` with our data, using our libraries and API calls from the backend server that we set up, as well as how we can bind the data and reference it in our Vue modules.

Hopefully, after making all these changes, your Vite instance is still running; if not, start it with `npm run dev`, and you should get the screenshot from _Figure 9__.4_. Click the **Click to Get** button and enter some data to send via the **Click to** **post** button.

Figure 9.5: Peeking into the HTTP traffic

It doesn’t work! We’re so close, but first, we have to revisit CORS from one of our previous chapters.

# CORS for secure applications

In [_Chapter 6_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093), _Moving to API-First_, we introduced the CORS middleware for our backend. We’ve now got to update our new backend service. It will need to respond to `OPTION` preflight requests, as we discussed in [_Chapter 6_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093), _Moving to API-First_, and will also need to identify the URLs that we’re going to allow to talk to our service. This is necessary to ensure our browsers aren’t being tricked into submitting/modifying applications from other sources.

Open up the `backend/server.go` sample you’ve been running and review the main function:

```markup
...
    port := ":8000"
    rtr := mux.NewRouter()
    rtr.Handle("/", appGET()).Methods(http.MethodGet)
    rtr.Handle("/", appPOST()).Methods(http.MethodPost,
                                       http.MethodOptions)
    // Apply the CORS middleware to our top-level router, with     // the defaults.
    rtr.Use(
        handlers.CORS(
          handlers.AllowedHeaders(
           []string{"X-Requested-With",            "Origin", "Content-Type",}),
          handlers.AllowedOrigins([]string{
           "http://0.0.0.0:3000",            "http://localhost:3000"}),
            handlers.AllowCredentials(),
            handlers.AllowedMethods([]string{
                http.MethodGet,
                http.MethodPost,
            })),
    )
    log.Printf("Listening on http://0.0.0.0%s/", port)
    http.ListenAndServe(port, rtr)
```

As before, I’ve put the key parts in bold. You can see we’ve appended `http.MethodOptions` to our `POST` handler, and we’ve also layered in some additional middleware.

`AllowedHeaders` has been included, and we’re specifically accepting `Content-Type` as, by default, we won’t accept JSON – only `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain` are accepted.

We also use `AllowCredentials` to specify that the user agent may pass authentication details along with the request, and finally, we’re specifying our dev server’s location, both for `localhost` and the `0.0.0.0` address. This might be slight overkill but can help if your backend and frontend start differently.

For a production-ready version of our project, you will want to inject these as environment variables to avoid mixing development and production config files. If you leverage `env.go` from [_Chapter 6_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093), _Moving to API - First_ – available at [https://github.com/ImagineDevOps DevOps/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Go/blob/main/Chapter06/internal/env.go](https://github.com/ImagineDevOps DevOps/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Go/blob/main/Chapter06/internal/env.go) – you will do something like the following:

```markup
rtr.Use(
    handlers.CORS(
        handlers.AllowedHeaders(
            env.GetAsSlice("ALLOWED_HEADERS")),
        handlers.AllowedOrigins(
            env.GetAsSlice("ORIGIN_WHITELIST")),
        handlers.AllowCredentials(),
        handlers.AllowedMethods([]string{
            http.MethodGet,
            http.MethodPost,
        })),
    )
```

Once your server is configured correctly, (re)start both the backend and the frontend, and you should now be able to call your backend service to use `GET` and `POST`. You’ve now completed a full-stack project!

![Figure 9.6: UI displaying output from the server](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_9.06_B18295.jpg)

Figure 9.6: UI displaying output from the server

In this section, we looked at adding CORS functionality to our application, allowing the frontend to access our API. In the next section, we will look at exploring Vue middleware that will help to provide common data transformation functionality.

# Creating Vue middleware

Working with Vue (and Axios) and Golang, we’ve shown we can bring all of learning so far all together, but we’ve missed one small aspect. We’ve deliberately omitted the JSON `struct` tags from our Golang code. If we add them back into our `backend/server.go` and rerun both the server and app, our requests no longer work!

```markup
func appPOST() http.HandlerFunc {
    type RequestBody struct {
        InboundMsg string `json:"inbound_msg,omitempty"`
    }
    type ResponseBody struct {
        OutboundMsg string `json:"outbound_msg,omitempty"`
    }
...
```

Our frontend and backend can no longer communicate as the contract has changed; the frontend is communicating in CamelCase, while the backend is communicating in snake\_case.

This isn’t a show-stopper, as we’ve proven we can work around it, but sometimes we don’t have the luxury of telling the backend service what format to use. Thankfully, Axios can be modified to add transformers to our requests that will modify inbound and outbound requests to match whichever backend formatting we’re given.

To build our transformers, we’ll install and use two new packages to help us to create our transformers. These will be used to convert between the different formats/case types:

```markup
$ npm install snakecase-keys camelcase-keys
```

Finally, we’ll modify our `lib/api.js` file to use these libraries to format our payloads:

```markup
import axios from 'axios';
import camelCaseKeys from 'camelcase-keys';
import snakeCaseKeys from 'snakecase-keys';
function isObject(value) {
  return typeof value === 'object' && value instanceof
    Object;
}
export function transformSnakeCase(data) {
  if (isObject(data) || Array.isArray(data)) {
    return snakeCaseKeys(data, { deep: true });
  }
  if (typeof data === 'string') {
    try {
      const parsedString = JSON.parse(data);
      const snakeCase = snakeCaseKeys(parsedString, { deep:
                                      true });
      return JSON.stringify(snakeCase);
    } catch (error) {
      // Bailout with no modification
      return data;
    }
  }
  return data;
}
export function transformCamelCase(data) {
  if (isObject(data) || Array.isArray(data)) {
    return camelCaseKeys(data, { deep: true });
  }
  return data;
}
export default axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_API_URL,
  withCredentials: true,
  transformRequest: [...axios.defaults.transformRequest,
                     transformSnakeCase],
  transformResponse: [...axios.defaults.transformResponse,
                      transformCamelCase],
});
```

This code might look like a lot, but it’s what we need to create our transformers. We create a `to` function and a `from` function to add as transformers to the Axios instantiation. We transform the requests into snake\_case on the outbound/request and transform them to CamelCase on the inbound/response. If you want to dive into the specifics of creating transformers for Axios, you can find more on the website at [https://axios-http.com/docs/req\_config](https://axios-http.com/docs/req_config), which includes a look at all the other numerous configs and parameters that can be provided for the Axios library.

There are a few different methods/libraries we could use to accomplish the same goal – for example, the `humps` package from [https://www.npmjs.com/package/humps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humps) is another library we could use to expose similar functionality, but what we are using works well for our use case.

# Summary

This chapter introduced Tailwind CSS and discussed its utility-first approach. We’ve previously seen samples of it in [_Chapter 4_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053), _Serving and Embedding HTML Content_, where we were provided with the HTML/CSS, but this is our first look at using it and how we can rapidly create components outside of heavier frameworks, as well as how we can rapidly integrate it with our frontend Vue application with configuration and how we can test its successful installation.

In this chapter, we created a full-stack application, bringing our expertise together thus far. We’ve successfully built a frontend application in Vue that communicates with our backend in Golang; as part of this, we also looked at how to configure and use Axios and how to mitigate common CORS issues, before concluding with a brief look at using middleware in our Vue app to allow us to communicate across different JSON schemas in the backend.

In the next chapter, we’ll look into securing our sessions, using JWTs for sessions, middleware, and creating and using navigation guards in Vue.
