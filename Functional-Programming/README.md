# Functional Programming in Go.

**Apply functional techniques in Golang to improve the testability, readability, and security of your code**

## What is this course about?
Functional programming is a tool for every programmer’s toolbox. Go offers the flexibility to approach a problem with different methodologies, allowing you to tackle a problem in the style best suited for your solution. In this course, you’ll learn the what, when, and why of functional programming and see how to apply key concepts in Go.

This course covers the following exciting features:
* Gain a deeper understanding of functional programming through practical examples
* Build a solid foundation in core FP concepts and see how they apply to Go code
* Discover how FP can improve the testability of your code base
* Apply functional design patterns for problem solving
* Understand when to choose and not choose FP concepts
* Discover the benefits of functional programming when dealing with concurrent code

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter04.

The code will look like the following:
```
func rollDice() int {
    return rand.Intn(6)
}
```

**Following is what you need for this course:**
If you are a Go engineer with a background in traditionally object-oriented languages such as Java or C++ and want to broaden your knowledge of functional programming, this course is for you.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the course (Chapter 1-11).
