# Functional Design Patterns

In this chapter, we will move to a higher level of abstraction. Rather than talking about individual functions and operations, let’s take a look at some design patterns. While we will not extensively explain each design pattern, we will take a look at how the object-oriented pattern translates to the functional world.

In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:

-   Classical design patterns in a functional paradigm:
    -   The strategy pattern
    -   The decorator pattern
    -   The Hollywood principle
-   Functional design patterns

# Classical design patterns in a functional paradigm

Anyone who has programmed in an object-oriented language will encounter design patterns at some point. Design patterns are a type of cookie-cutter solution to common engineering problems. One key point is that the solution they provide should be thought of as a starting point, a way to tackle a problem that has proven itself to be useful. Often, the solution is not readily usable out of the box and needs to be adapted to your concrete environment and situation. A given design pattern might provide 90% of a solution to a problem, and the remaining 10% is filled in with custom, non-pattern code.

This chapter does not aim to exhaustively cover design patterns. In fact, entire books have been written about design patterns, such as the well-known _Gang of Four_ book, _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_. What this chapter does aim to do is to showcase how certain object-oriented design patterns translate to the functional paradigm, and how they are often simpler to express in this paradigm. For each design pattern, we will take a look at the object-oriented implementation, the general problem and benefit of the pattern, and finally, what the functional implementation looks like. We’ll start off with the strategy pattern and continue with the decorator pattern and the **Inversion of Control** (**IoC**) principle.

These are three patterns that are common to object-oriented code. The strategy pattern is a way to change the behavior of our program at runtime and decouple a class with a concrete implementation. The decorator pattern allows us to dynamically extend functions without breaking the open-closed principle, and the IoC principle is a staple of many object-oriented frameworks, whereby the order of control is delegated to the highest level in the call tree.

## The strategy pattern

The first pattern that we will take a look at is the strategy pattern. The strategy pattern is a design pattern that allows us to dynamically change the algorithm of a method or function at runtime. By doing this, we can modify the behavior of our program throughout its runtime. In the example that we will work out, we will have an `EncryptionService`, which supports various ciphers.

We’ll keep it simple and work with substitution ciphers that change the letters in the output. We will implement three different cipher mechanisms:

-   The Caesar cipher
-   The Atbash cipher
-   A custom cipher

Each cipher needs to support the encryption and decryption of a given string as follows:

```markup
Input = decipher(cipher(Input))
```

In other words, we should be able to reconstruct the input from a ciphered output. For our implementations, we will also limit ourselves to changing the letters of the alphabet a-z, and ignore casing.

Ciphers and security

It bears calling out that these ciphers should never be used for actual encryption. They are incredibly weak and offer no real protection against a malicious actor in this day and age. They are interesting to study for their historical context and are fun to implement while being easy to understand.

### Object-oriented strategy pattern

First, we will solve this problem in an object-oriented way. Remember that Go is a multi-paradigm language, so we can easily apply object-oriented design patterns in Go. _Figure 9__.1_ shows the architecture for this solution:

![Figure 9.1: Strategy pattern for cipher implementation](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781801811163/graphics/image/Figure_9.1_B18771.jpg)

Figure 9.1: Strategy pattern for cipher implementation

In the object-oriented implementation, we start with a `CipherService`. This is any class that wants to use a cipher. Rather than having a concrete implementation, `CipherService` instead contains a `CipherStrategy` through object composition. This `CipherStrategy` is an interface that specifies the `Cipher` and `Decipher` methods. Both methods take a string as input and return either a ciphered or deciphered string. In _Figure 9__.1_, we have three concrete implementations for the cipher:

-   Caesar
-   Atbash
-   A custom cipher

Each of these is a class (struct) that implements the required methods (`Cipher` and `Decipher`). We can also include a useful state in these classes, as we will see in the upcoming code examples, whereby we maintain a `Rotation` variable as part of the Caesar cipher. Both the Caesar cipher and the Atbash cipher are so-called substitution ciphers. They exchange one letter of the alphabet with another letter. In the case of the Caesar cipher, the replacement letter is situated a certain amount of positions further in the alphabet. For the Atbash cipher, this is a simple substitution of each letter with the letter of the same position in the reverse alphabet (z-a).

#### Caesar

Let’s start implementing this in Go. First, we’ll set up the `CipherService`, as well as a slice containing all letters of the alphabet that we’ll support. We will also need to figure out the index of a given rune in this slice of letters, which we will do by implementing an `indexOf` function:

```markup
var (
    alphabet [26]rune = [26]rune{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e',
    'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p',
    'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'}
)
func indexOf(r rune, rs [26]rune) (int, bool) {
    for i := 0; i < len(rs); i++ {
        if r == rs[i] {
            return i, true
        }
    }
    return -1, false
}
type CipherService struct {
    Strategy CipherStrategy
}
```

To follow a more traditional object-oriented language pattern, we can attach a `Cipher` and `Decipher` method to `CipherService` as well. This will just delegate the call to the chosen implementation (`Strategy`):

```markup
func (c CipherService) Cipher(input string) string {
        return c.Strategy.Cipher(input)
}
func (c CipherService) Decipher(input string) string {
        return c.Strategy.Decipher(input)
}
```

After this is set up, we will also define an interface, `CipherStrategy`, which will enforce any implementation to have the `Cipher` and `Decipher` methods:

```markup
type CipherStrategy interface {
    Cipher(string) string
    Decipher(string) string
}
```

With this in place, we can start implementing the strategies that we will support. For brevity, we will only implement the Caesar and Atbash cipher. Implementing a custom cipher, as in _Figure 9__.1_, would be a trivial extension of this. To implement the Caesar cipher, we will first define a struct to represent this strategy:

```markup
type CaesarCipher struct {
    Rotation int
}
```

The Caesar cipher is a cipher whereby a letter in the input is exchanged for a letter a certain number of positions further in the alphabet. The number of positions that we use is defined as the _rotation_ of the cipher. For example, if we have the `abc` input and a rotation of `1`, each letter is replaced with the letter 1 position further in the alphabet, so the output would be `bcd`.

Similarly, if the rotation were `2`, the output would be `cde`, and so on. The following is an implementation of the Caesar `Cipher` and `Decipher` methods in Go. Understanding the implementation is not that important; the important part is to note how we select which implementation `CipherService` uses and even change it during the execution of our program:

```markup
func (c CaesarCipher) Cipher(input string) string {
        output := ""
        for _, r := range input {
                if idx, ok := indexOf(r, alphabet); ok {
                        idx += c.Rotation
                        idx = idx % 26
                        output += string(alphabet[idx])
                } else {
                        output += string(r)
                }
        }
        return output
}
func (c CaesarCipher) Decipher(input string) string {
        output := ""
        for _, r := range input {
                if idx, ok := indexOf(r, alphabet); ok {
                        idx += (26 - c.Rotation)
                        idx = idx % 26
                        output += string(alphabet[idx])
                } else {
                        output += string(r)
                }
        }
        return output
}
```

Now that we have the Caesar cipher implemented, let’s also implement the Atbash cipher.

#### Atbash

The Atbash cipher is a straightforward replacement of each letter with the letter at the same index but with the alphabet in reverse. So, `a` becomes `z`, `b` becomes `y`, and on until `z` becomes `a`. As a result, deciphering can be achieved by calling the cipher again, as we are effectively mirroring the alphabet (and mirroring twice returns the original result).

We don’t need any real state to manage with the `AtbashCipher` struct, unlike `CaesarCipher`, where we maintained the rotation as a class variable. However, we will still need to create the struct for our strategy pattern implementation to work correctly. It will just be an empty struct with functions attached to it:

```markup
type AtbashCipher struct {}
func (a AtbashCipher) Cipher(input string) string {
        output := ""
        for _, r := range input {
                if idx, ok := indexOf(r, alphabet); ok {
                        idx = 25 - idx
                        output += string(alphabet[idx])
                } else {
                        output += string(r)
                }
        }
        return output
}
func (a AtbashCipher) Decipher(input string) string {
        return a.Cipher(input)
}
```

Again, the actual implementation of the code here is not that important. It is neat that we can decipher it by just calling `Cipher` again, and this will become even more interesting in the functional example. Either way, let’s look at how we can change the implementation during execution and switch between `CaesarCipher` and `AtbashCipher`:

```markup
func main() {
        svc := CipherService{}
        svc.Strategy = CaesarCipher{Rotation: 10}
        fmt.Println(svc.Cipher("helloworld"))
        svc.Strategy = AtbashCipher{}
        fmt.Println(svc.Cipher("helloworld"))
}
```

This is the object-oriented implementation of the strategy pattern. We have created three classes (`CipherService`, `CaesarCipher`, and `AtbashCipher`) one interface (`CipherStrategy`), and two functions per struct (to cipher and decipher). Now, let’s take a look at a functional implementation.

### Functional implementation of the strategy pattern

We have already seen in previous chapters how we can dynamically change the implementation details of an algorithm by leveraging the fact that functions are first-class citizens, and we can pass them around like objects in a traditional object-oriented language. If we refactored our `CipherService`, all we would need to know is that this service needs a function to take a string and return a string twice (one for ciphering and one for deciphering).

To start off, let’s define the struct for this new service, as well as two types to define the `Cipher` and `Decipher` functions:

```markup
type (
        CipherFunc   func(string) string
        DecipherFunc func(string) string
)
type CipherService struct {
    CipherFn   CipherFunc
    DecipherFn DecipherFunc
}
func (c CipherService) Cipher(input string) string {
    return c.CipherFn(input)
}
func (c CipherService) Decipher(input string) string {
    return c.DecipherFn(input)
}
```

Now that we have `CipherService` in place, we need to define our Caesar and Atbash cipher-related functions. Unlike in the object-oriented example, we don’t need to define a new struct to do so. We can define our functions in the same package as our `CipherService` but we would not have to do so. In fact, any function of the correct type can be used as a `Cipher` or `Decipher` function.

Let’s implement `CaesarCipher` first. The one thing we do have to be aware of is that we do not have a struct that can hold the state anymore. In our example, the `CaesarCipher` struct stored `Rotation` as a class variable. In the functional approach, the rotation needs to be part of the `CaesarCipher` function itself. It’s a minor but important change. Apart from this change, the implementation remains the same:

```markup
func CaesarCipher(input string, rotation int) string {
    output := ""
    for _, r := range input {
        idx := indexOf(r, alphabet)
        idx += rotation
        idx = idx % 26
        output += string(alphabet[idx])
    }
    return output
}
func CaesarDecipher(input string, rotation int) string {
    output := ""
    for _, r := range input {
        idx := indexOf(r, alphabet)
        idx += (26 - rotation)
        idx = idx % 26
        output += string(alphabet[idx])
    }
    return output
}
```

Similarly, we can implement `AtbashCipher` as a function. One nice thing here is that due to the relationship between ciphering and deciphering with Atbash, we don’t have to actually write any implementation for the `Decipher` function. Rather, we can just equate the `Decipher` function to the `Cipher` function:

```markup
func AtbashCipher(input string) string {
    output := ""
    for _, r := range input {
        if idx, ok := indexOf(r, alphabet); ok {
            idx = 25 - idx
            output += string(alphabet[idx])
        } else {
            output += string(r)
        }
    }
    return output
}
var AtbashDecipher = AtbashCipher
```

The last line effectively defines a new function, `AtbashDecipher`, with the same implementation as `AtbashCipher`, once again leveraging the fact that our functions are simply data, which can be stored as variables in Go.

When using this functional implementation in Go, we have to provide a function of the `func(string) string` type to both the `Cipher` and `Decipher` implementation of our service. As a result of `CaesarCipher` requiring an extra variable to determine the rotation, we do need to create a closure for our `CipherService`. In our `main` method, we can dynamically update the cipher that we want to use to `AtbashCipher` without the need for a closure, as the Atbash cipher is a straightforward cipher that adheres to `func(string) string`:

```markup
func main() {
    fpSvc := {
        CipherFn: func(input string) string {
            return (input, 10)
        },
        DecipherFn: func(input string) string {
            Return fp.CaesarDecipher(input, 10)
        },
    }
    fmt.Println(fpSvc.Cipher("helloworld"))
    fpSvc.CipherFn = AtbashCipher
    fpSvc.DecipherFn = AtbashDeciphe
    fmt.Println(fpSvc.Cipher("helloworld"))
    fmt.Println(fpSvc.Decipher(fpSvc.Cipher("hello")))
}
```

This example prints some ciphered and deciphered content using our functional implementation. Using this functional implementation, we could easily implement ad hoc ciphers without defining them as standalone functions. Both the `Cipher` and `Decipher` implementation accept anonymous functions to specify the implementation details. This is what we have done to make the Caesar cipher work by wrapping it in such an anonymous function.

## The decorator pattern

Let’s modify our code to also adhere to the decorator pattern. The decorator pattern is a way to add functionality to our methods and classes without having to modify them. This means that the _open-closed_ part of SOLID is respected. When programming in an object-oriented fashion, this is done through function composition (and often with inheritance in languages that support this). In Go, composition is the favored way of composing structs, so the decorator pattern feels natural for both a functional and object-oriented style implementation.

SOLID principles for object-oriented design

SOLID is a set of principles for designing robust object-oriented systems. It stands for **Single-Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion**. These principles are good to adhere to regardless of which paradigm you use, but their implementation differs. For example, functions should have a single responsibility, be closed to modification but open to extension, and functions should rely on abstract (higher-order) functions rather than concrete implementations.

### Object-oriented decorator pattern

First, let’s start off by implementing the decorator pattern in an object-oriented way. We’ll extend our strategy pattern example of the various ciphers. To keep things simple, let’s just say we want to log the input to each `Cipher` and `Decipher` function. To make our program more composable, we don’t want to add the `log` function by modifying the existing `CaesarCipher` and `AtbashCipher` structs. If we were to do so, we would also have to update the `log` functionality for each struct in case the logging requirements change. Instead, what we will do is implement a `LogCipherDecorator` struct. This struct adheres to the `CipherStrategy` interface by implementing a function for both `Cipher` and `Decipher`. These functions will first write to a log and then delegate each call to the underlying `Cipher` or `Decipher` implementation. _Figure 9__.2_ shows the class diagram for this pattern.

![Figure 9.2: Class diagram for the decorator pattern](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781801811163/graphics/image/Figure_9.2_B18771.jpg)

Figure 9.2: Class diagram for the decorator pattern

Now, we can turn this into code; let’s look at the struct definition first. We have a new `LogCipherDecorator` struct, which uses `CipherStrategy` through composition:

```markup
type CipherLogDecorator struct {
    CipherI CipherStrategy
}
```

Now, we will also implement the necessary functions to have this new struct adhere to `CipherStrategy` itself. In each function, first, we will log the input prior to dispatching the call to the underlying `CipherStrategy`:

```markup
func (c CipherLogDecorator) Cipher(input string) string {
    log.Printf("ciphering: %s\n", input)
    return c.CipherI.Cipher(input)
}
func (c CipherLogDecorator) Decipher(input string) string {
    log.Printf("deciphering: %s\n", input)
    return c.CipherI.Decipher(input)
}
```

That is essentially all that is required to implement the decorator pattern. It comes in handy in a variety of scenarios, but it’s encountered especially often when working with **User Interface** (**UI**) code (Java UI libraries such as Swing tend to use this extensively).

In the `main` function, we can now use `CipherLogDecorator` anywhere that we expect `CipherStrategy`. We’ll have to instantiate the decorator with the underlying class to get the additional functionality:

```markup
func main() {
    cld := {
        CipherI: oop.CaesarCipher{Rotation: 10},
    }
    svc := oop.CipherService{Strategy: cld}
    ciphered := svc.Cipher("helloworld")
    fmt.Println(ciphered)
}
```

In this snippet, we can see how `CipherService` accepts `CipherLogDecorator` just like any other `CipherService`. When we run this `main` function, the log statement appears before each print statement. Running that function, we get the following:

```markup
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-29-49 Chapter9]$ go run main.go
2023/01/14 15:50:05 ciphering: helloworld
rovvygybvn
```

Next, let’s functionally implement this and compare the two approaches.

### Functional decorator pattern implementation

Applying the decorator pattern to functional programming does not require anything that we haven’t seen before in this book. We have learned about function composition and used that in previous chapters. The decorator pattern for object-oriented code really is nothing more than function composition in the functional programming paradigm.

As such, creating a function for adding a log statement prior to each `cipher` or `decipher` call is a matter of creating a higher-order function that takes either a `Cipher` or `Decipher` function as input, and returns a new function, which first calls `log` and then delegates the remainder of the functionality to the underlying function. Let’s make this concrete by looking at the decorating functions for ciphering and deciphering, `LogCipher` and `LogDecipher`:

```markup
func LogCipher(cipher CipherFunc) CipherFunc {
    return func(input string) string {
        log.Printf("ciphering: %s\n", input)
        return cipher(input)
    }
}
func LogDecipher(decipher DecipherFunc) DecipherFunc {
    return func(input string) string {
        log.Printf("deciphering: %s\n", input)
        return decipher(input)
    }
}
```

In essence, that’s all that needs to happen to decorate functions with new functionality. `LogCipher` accepts any function that adheres to the `CipherFunc` type definition and returns a new function that also adheres to that type definition. The new function, created as an anonymous function returned from `LogCipher`, then calls `log` and subsequently our `CipherFunc` that was passed initially.

The main difference in the implementation strategy with the object-oriented and functional paradigms is just how we define adherence to the expected functionality. With an object-oriented approach, we use interfaces to define adherence, while with the functional approach, we use the type system to define adherence.

In our `main` function, we can create `CipherService` using the decorator functions rather than the underlying ciphers:

```markup
func main() {
    caesarCipher := func(input string) string {
        return CaesarCipher(input, 10)
    }
    caesarDecipher := func(input string) string {
        return CaesarDecipher(input, 10)
    }
    fpSvc := {
        CipherFn:  LogCipher(caesarCipher),
        DecipherFn: LogDecipher(caesarDecipher),
    }
    fmt.Println(fpSvc.Cipher("hello"))
}
```

Notice that in this example, for readability, the decorator functions are split from the creation of `CipherService`, but this could have been done in line, as in the earlier strategy pattern implementation. If we created `CipherService` with `AtbashCipher` instead, it makes for a more readable example:

```markup
func main() {
    fpSvc := fp.CipherService{
        CipherFn:   fp.LogCipher(caesarCipher),
        DecipherFn: fp.LogDecipher(caesarDecipher),
    }
    fmt.Println(fpSvc.Cipher("hello"))
}
```

As we can see from the examples, function composition is the key to decorating functions with additional functionality, which can then be shared across implementations. Another advantage of what we have done so far can be described as the _Hollywood principle_, also known as the _IoC_ principle.

## The Hollywood principle

The Hollywood principle of _don’t call us, we’ll call you_ is also known as the IoC principle. IoC is an abstraction of the well-known Dependency Injection pattern. Dependency Injection is an important aspect of writing object-oriented applications and is useful for the functional paradigm as well.

Without going too in-depth into the object-oriented implementation, the key takeaway is that objects should defer concrete implementations of their dependencies to the highest level in the object/call hierarchy. We have done this implicitly in the previous examples for our cipher implementations by leveraging interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Notice that the object-oriented `CipherService` did not specify which cipher it would use and instead, we deferred that choice to the creator of `CipherService` by just asking for an implementation of the `CipherStrategy` interface:

```markup
type CipherStrategy interface {
    Cipher(string) string
    Decipher(string) string
}
type CipherService struct {
    Strategy CipherStrategy
}
```

Go lends itself quite naturally to this way of programming by not having explicit constructors for structs. In a language such as Java, where objects can be instantiated with default class-level objects through object composition, it is easier to ignore programming against an abstract implementation. For example, the following Java snippet would show an implementation of a `CipherService` that does not adhere to IoC but uses a specific type of cipher (the Caesar cipher, in this case):

```markup
class CaesarCipher {
    int rotation;
    CaesarCipher(int rotation) {
        this.rotation = rotation;
    }
}
class CipherService {
    CaesarCipher cipher = new CaesarCipher();
    CipherService() {}
    public String cipher(String input) {
        String result = "";
        // implement cipher
        return result;
    }
}
```

Why do we highlight this Java code here? First, to show that Go’s struct paradigm lends itself naturally to IoC by way of struct instantiation without constructors. This means that structs do not have an inherent class state.

This brings us to the functional implementations of services. In Go, we have two ways of making IoC happen:

-   The first way is through the use of interfaces, as we have done in the object-oriented examples
-   The second way is to use type definitions and functions as first-class citizens to abstract over the behavior of a struct

To illustrate the difference, the following are the two definitions of the `CipherService` that we have used, and both apply IoC in alignment with their paradigm.

First, let’s show the object-oriented way:

```markup
type CipherStrategy interface {
    Cipher(string) string
    Decipher(string) string
}
type CipherService struct {
    Strategy CipherStrategy
}
```

And now the functional way:

```markup
type (
    CipherFunc   func(string) string
    DecipherFunc func(string) string
)
type CipherService struct {
    CipherFn   CipherFunc
    DecipherFn DecipherFunc
}
```

This was just a brief segue to point out what is happening in both instances. Let’s continue our discussion of design patterns.

Just Imagine

# Functional design patterns

In the preceding sections of this chapter, we have compared functional and object-oriented design patterns (strategy, decorator, and Dependency Injection/IoC). If we look at the main differences between the functional and object-oriented patterns, it becomes clear that our patterns are achieved through different combinations of functions. We are either using functions as first-class citizens to store them as variables within a struct, or we are using function composition, higher-order functions, anonymous functions, and closures to achieve what would traditionally have been achieved with interfaces and the inheritance of classes.

And this really should be the main takeaway when writing functional code. Everything is a function. Design patterns become patterns of function combinations. As such, there is no real counterpart to the traditional design patterns outlined by the _Gang of Four_ for the object-oriented world. So, what does the functional paradigm offer in terms of design patterns? Well, if we go back to the definition of design patterns, we can see that a pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly encountered problem. It is a cookie-cutter approach that might solve 85% of your problem, while the remaining 15% remains to be solved beyond the pattern. Functional programming does offer these solutions, and we discussed many of them earlier in this book.

When you think of function currying to compose different functions together and reducing each function to a 1-ary function to then combine them into any n-ary function, these steps can be thought of as a functional design pattern. Similarly, using closures, monads, and callbacks through CPS all can be thought of as patterns that are applied to solve a common problem. What we don’t have in functional programming is the overhead of object taxonomy, which is what the design patterns in object-oriented code reflect. You could argue that the need for design patterns in traditional object-oriented languages is more of a solution to a limitation in the programming language itself rather than a real benefit to the programmer.

One of the ways traditional design patterns are avoided is through the use of function composition, but an equally critical component is leveraging the type system – a type system that can assign a concrete type to a function of a specified signature. Looking at object-oriented design patterns, whether the decorator pattern, factory pattern, or visitor pattern, they leverage interfaces extensively to abstract the implementation details. In Go, we can use the type system to abstract the implementation, as we have done in the earlier examples.

If we summed up how to solve a particular design problem in the functional paradigm, it would be rather boring, as the problem either does not exist or is solved through functions. Our solution would just look like _Table 9.1_:

<table id="table001-3" class="No-Table-Style _idGenTablePara-1"><colgroup><col> <col></colgroup><tbody><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Design Pattern</strong></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Solution</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break">Strategy pattern</span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>Functions (higher-order functions + <span class="No-Break">function types)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break">Decorator pattern</span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>Function <span class="No-Break">composition (closures)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break">Factory pattern</span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>No real need, as we don’t need objects, but we could create functions with a set of default values – so, this would be <span class="No-Break">function currying</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break">Visitor pattern</span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break">Functions</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break">Singleton pattern</span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>No need, as we avoid objects and <span class="No-Break">mutable state</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break">Adapter</span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>Could be seen as <span class="No-Break">function mapping</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break">Façade</span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break">Functions again</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Table 9.1: Design patterns and their functional solution

In Go, however, we are working with a multi-paradigm language, so we get to have the best of both worlds. We can leverage some design patterns when we are working with structs, but their implementation is simplified in many ways through the use of functional programming principles rather than object-oriented ones. Despite creating an interface to abstract the implementation of a struct’s functionality, we can use a function that adheres to a given type, as we have done with `CipherService`.

Just Imagine

# Summary

In this chapter, we took a look at the design patterns common in object-oriented code, namely the strategy pattern, the decorator pattern, and the Hollywood principle (IoC). We saw that these can be implemented in Go without the need for extensive object taxonomy simply by leveraging functions as first-class citizens. We also discussed the need for design patterns in the functional paradigm and concluded that either the patterns are not needed or can be solved using functions. In terms of real functional code that is reusable for solving common problems, we pointed at concepts such as function currying and function composition. In the next chapter, we will take a look at how functional programming can be leveraged to implement concurrent code.
