# Go Network Automation


**Learn how to automate network operations and build applications using the Go programming language**

## What is this course about?
Go’s built-in first-class concurrency mechanisms make it an ideal choice for long-lived low-bandwidth I/O operations, which are typical requirements of network automation and network operations applications.

This course covers the following exciting features:
* Understand Go programming language basics via network-related examples
* Find out what features make Go a powerful alternative for network automation
* Explore network automation goals, benefits, and common use cases
* Discover how to interact with network devices using a variety of technologies
* Integrate Go programs into an automation framework
* Take advantage of the OpenConfig ecosystem with Go
* Build distributed and scalable systems for network observability


## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, ch01.

The code will look like the following:
```
func main() {     
    a := -1     
    
    var b uint32     
    b = 4294967295     
    
    var c float32 = 42.1
}
```

**Following is what you need for this course:**
This course is for all network engineers, administrators, and other network practitioners looking to understand what network automation is and how the Go programming language can help develop network automation solutions.
