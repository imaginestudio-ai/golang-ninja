# Feature Flags

In this chapter, we will learn about feature flags, what they are, how to use them, and the benefits of using them. Using feature flags is not mandatory for applications. However, as application complexity increases, the need for feature flags will arise.

There are many different features provided by feature flags, but in this chapter, we will focus on how to use feature flags to enable/disable certain features in an application. We will be using an open source, simple version of the feature flag server to demonstrate the integration for both frontend and backend services.

In this chapter, we’ll cover the following topics:

-   Understanding what feature flags are all about
-   Installing an open source feature flag server
-   Enabling/disabling features using feature flags
-   Integrating feature flags for frontend and backend services

# An introduction to feature flags

In the current rapidly changing world, developers need to make changes and roll out new features almost every single day, if not quicker. Sometimes, this requires features to be built even before there are any user needs. Having the ability to deploy features into production without disruption is the holy grail of software development.

Features that are deployed to production may or may not be made available to users; this all depends on tactical decisions on the business side. Developers will keep on releasing features to production and, when the time is right, the feature will be made available with a click of a button from the business side. This kind of facility is provided by the feature flag.

In simple terms, feature flags are like on/off switches that we can use to enable/disable features in our applications without creating disruption. Enabling features will also allow companies to strategically enable or disable features depending on the market and users’ needs, which can impact the bottom line of a company.

As a tool, feature flags not only provide the ability to run on/off features but there are also many other benefits you can also get out of it:

-   Testing features for certain demographics based on certain conditions such as geographical location, user’s age, and so on
-   Splitting of the traffic request based on network condition
-   Conducting UX experiments to understand which design works well

In this chapter, we will look at an open source project feature flag tool to demonstrate how to use and integrate it.

# Feature flag configuration

You can use feature flags by deploying them in your infrastructure or by using software-as-a-service solutions such as LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith, and many other available solutions. Each of the solutions provides its own API, which needs to be integrated into your application. This means that your application is tied to the solution that you choose. There is no one-size-fits-all solution; it all depends on what kind of features you need for your application.

Let’s take a look at different kinds of configuration for using feature flags. _Figure 11__.1_ shows the simplest way to use feature flags.

![Figure 11.1: A web client using feature flags](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_11.01_B18295.jpg)

Figure 11.1: A web client using feature flags

The web client will enable or disable the user interface depending on the feature flag. For example, in an application, a particular menu selection can be enabled when the feature flag related to the menu is turned on.

_Figure 11__.2_ shows a different configuration where the web client will call different microservices, depending on which feature flag is turned on/off:

![Figure 11.2: Feature flag microservices](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_11.02_B18295.jpg)

Figure 11.2: Feature flag microservices

In the preceding example, the web client calls microservice A when feature flag A is turned on.

Another interesting configuration is shown in _Figure 11__.3_, where the main microservice will determine which user interface will be returned back to the web client, depending on which feature flag has been configured:

![Figure 11.3: The feature flags for microservices](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_11.03_B18295_to_be_Redrawn.jpg)

Figure 11.3: The feature flags for microservices

In the above example, the web client will get a different response to render if the main microservice detects that feature flag C has been enabled, which will get the response from MicroService C.

So, as we can see, there are different ways to use feature flags and different places to use them. It all comes down to what will be needed for your application.

In the next section, we will look at using an open source feature flag server to enable/disable buttons in a sample web app.

Just Imagine

# Use cases for using feature flags

Feature flags are not limited to flags that can be configured to turn on/off features inside applications; there are many more features and capabilities. In this section, we will look at the features provided in a full-blown feature flag server:

-   **Segment targeting** – ImagineDevOps  you are building a feature that you want to test on a group of users in your application. For example, you may want a certain group of users that are based in the USA to use the checkout feature based on PayPal.
-   **Risk mitigation** – Building product features does not guarantee that a feature will bring in more users. New features can be released and, with time and more analysis, if it is found that the feature is providing a bad user experience, it will be turned off as part of the risk mitigation process.
-   **Gathering feedback before launch** – Using a targeted rollout for a certain group of users, it is possible to get feedback as early as possible from the user. The feedback will provide insight for the team to decide whether the feature indeed provides any additional benefit to the user or not.

Now we have a good understanding of the use cases for feature flag, we will look at installing the feature flag server in the next section.

## Installing the feature flag server

We are going to use an open source feature flag server. Clone the project from the [github.com/nanikjava/feature-flags](http://github.com/nanikjava/feature-flags) repository as follows:

```markup
git clone https://github.com/nanikjava/feature-flags
```

From your terminal, change the directory into the project directory and build the server using the following command:

```markup
go build -o fflag .
```

We are using the `-o` flag to compile the application and output it to a filename called `fflag`. Now that the server has been compiled and is ready to use, open a separate terminal window and run the server as follows:

```markup
./fflag
```

You will see the following output:

```markup
2022/07/30 15:10:38 Feature flag is up listening on  :8080
```

The server is now listening on port `8080`. Now, we need to add a new feature flag for our web app, and the key is called `disable_get`. The way to do this is to use the `curl` command line to send data using `POST` as follows:

```markup
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/features -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"key":"disable_get","enabled":false,"users":[],"groups":["dev","admin"],"percentage":0}' 
```

The `curl` command is calling the `/features` endpoint and passing the JSON data. Once this has completed successfully, you will see the following output:

```markup
{
  "key": "disable_get",
  "enabled": false,
  "users": [],
  "groups": [
    "dev",
    "admin"
  ],
  "percentage": 0
} 
```

The JSON output shows that the feature flag server now has a new key called `disable_get`, and it is disabled, as indicated by the flag `enabled: false`. The output should look as follows, showing that the data has been successfully added:

```markup
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
…
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 201 Created
…
< Content-Length: 89
<
{"key":"disable_get","enabled":false,"users":[],"groups":["dev","admin"],"percentage":0}
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

The feature flag server is ready with the data we need. In the next section, we will look at using the flag inside our web app.

# The high-level architecture of feature flags

_Figure 11__.4_ shows the architecture of the open source feature flag server at a high level.

![Figure 11.4: The high-level architecture](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_11.04_to_be_redrawn_B18295.jpg)

Figure 11.4: The high-level architecture

Looking at the diagram, the server uses mux.Router to route for different HTTP requests such as `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PATCH`. The server uses an internal database as persistent storage for the feature flags that the application requires.

The server is accessible via HTTP request calls that can be made from both web clients and microservices using the normal HTTP protocol.

Just Imagine

# Integration of the feature flag

After we have installed the feature flag server, we want to start using it in our application. In this section, we will look at integrating the feature flag to enable/disable certain user interface elements in the frontend and to call only the backend services from our server that are enabled.

## Web application

The sample app we are going to use can be found inside the `chapter11/frontend-enable-disable` folder; the sample app demonstrates how to use the feature flag to enable/disable the user interface button. Open the terminal and change into the `chapter11/frontend-enable-disable` directory to run the web app as follows:

```markup
npm install
npm run dev
```

The commands will install all the necessary packages and then run the web app. Once the command completes, open your browser and type `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar. You will see the web app shown in _Figure 11__.5_.

![Figure 11.5: The initial view of the web app using the feature flag](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_11.05_B18295.jpg)

Figure 11.5: The initial view of the web app using the feature flag

What you are seeing in _Figure 11__.5_ is that one of the buttons has been disabled. This is based on the flag value that we set in the previous section. The flag data looks as follows:

```markup
{
  "key": "disable_get",
  "enabled": false,
  "users": [],
  "groups": [
    "dev",
    "admin"
  ],
  "percentage": 0
}
```

The `disable_get` key is the flag key we added to the server and the `enabled` field is set to `false`, which means that the button is disabled. Let’s change the `enabled` field to `true` and let’s see how the web page changes.

Use the following command in a terminal to update the data:

```markup
curl -v -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/features/disable_get -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"disable_get","enabled":true}'
```

The `curl` command updates the `enabled` field to `true`. Refresh the browser page and you will see the button is enabled, as shown in _Figure 11__.6_.

![Figure 11.6: The Click to Get button is enabled](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_11.06_B18295.jpg)

Figure 11.6: The Click to Get button is enabled

The following code snippet from the `HelloWorld.vue` file takes care of reading the key from the server, using it to enable/disable the button:

```markup
...
<script>
import axios from 'axios';
export default {
 data() {
   return {
     enabled: true
   }
 },
 mounted() {
   axios({method: "GET", "url":
     "http://localhost:8080/features/disable_get"}).then(result        => {
     this.enabled = result.data.enabled
     console.log(result);
   }, error => {
     console.error(error);
   });
 }
}
</script>
<template>
 <div  v-if="enabled" class="flex space-2 justify-center">
   ...
   </button>
 </div>
 ...
```

In the next section, we will look at using the feature flag to enable/disable certain features on the backend service.

## Microservice integration

In this section, we will use the feature flag to enable/disable certain services. This will give the application the flexibility to access only the services that are currently enabled. _Figure 11__.7_ shows how the microservice will be structured. The application is inside the `chapter11/multiple-service` folder.

![Figure 11.7: The microservice structure for the feature flag](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_11.07_B18295.jpg)

Figure 11.7: The microservice structure for the feature flag

Following the steps from the previous section to run the feature flag server, use the following command to create the flags:

```markup
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/features -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"serviceb", "enabled":true,"users":[],"groups":["dev","admin"],"percentage":0}'
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/features -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"servicea", "enabled":false,"users":[],"groups":["dev","admin"],"percentage":0}' 
```

The command creates two keys: `servicea` and `serviceb`. For now, `servicea` is disabled, while `serviceb` is enabled. Once the feature flags have been set up, we are going to run different services:

-   **Main server** – open the terminal and make sure you are inside the `chapter11/multiple-service/mainserver` directory. Run the main server with the following command:
    
    ```markup
    go run main.go 
    ```
    

The main server will run on port `8080`.

-   `servicea` – open the terminal and change the directory to `chapter11/multiple-service/servicea`. Run the service with the following command:
    
    ```markup
    go run main.go  
    ```
    

`servicea` will run on port `8081`.

-   `serviceb` – open the terminal and change the directory to `chapter11/multiple-service/serviceb`. Run the service with the following command:
    
    ```markup
    go run main.go 
    ```
    

`serviceb` will run on port `8082`.

We now have three different services running on ports `8080`, `8081`, and `8082`. Open your browser and access the service using `http://localhost:8000`. You will get a response like the following:

```markup
{"Message":"-ServiceB active"}
```

The response sent back came from `serviceb` as `servicea` is disabled, as per the configuration from the feature flag server. Now, let’s turn on the flag for `servicea` using the following command:

```markup
curl -v -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/features/servicea -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"enabled":true}'
```

Restart the main server by force-stopping it using _Ctrl + C_. Re-run it using the same command discussed previously. Open your browser and access the service using `http://localhost:8000`. You should get a result like the following:

```markup
{"Message":"ServiceA active-ServiceB active"}
```

We get responses from both services now that both have been enabled.

Let’s take a look at the code to understand how the feature flag is used. The following snippet shows part of the code to start the server:

```markup
...
func main() {
  port := ":8000"
  ...
  wg := &sync.WaitGroup{}
  wg.Add(1)
  go func(w *sync.WaitGroup) {
     defer w.Done()
     serviceA = checkFlags("servicea")
     serviceB = checkFlags("serviceb")
  }(wg)
  wg.Wait()
  http.ListenAndServe(port, rtr)
}
```

The code calls the feature flag server to get flag information for `servicea` and `serviceb` in a goroutine. Once completed, it starts the server to listen on port `8000`. The state of the services is stored inside the `servicea` and `serviceb` variables, which will be used in other parts of the code, as shown in the following code snippet:

```markup
func handler() http.HandlerFunc {
  type ResponseBody struct {
     Message string
  }
  return func(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
     var a, b string
     if serviceA {
        a = callService("8081")
     }
     if serviceB {
        b = callService("8082")
     }
     json.NewEncoder(rw).Encode(ResponseBody{
        Message: a + "-" + b,
     })
  }
}
```

The `handler()` method is called when you access the server on port `8000`. Inside the code, as can be seen, it calls the service only when it is enabled. Once the service is called, the results from the service are combined and sent back to the client as a single JSON response.

The following code snippet shows how to access the feature flag server to extract the different flags. It uses a normal HTTP GET call:

```markup
func checkFlags(key string) bool {
  ...
  requestURL := fmt.Sprintf("http://localhost:%d/features/%s",    8080, key)
  res, err := http.Get(requestURL)
  ...
  resBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)
  if err != nil {
     log.Printf("client: could not read response body: %s\n",       err)
     os.Exit(1)
  }
  ...
  return f.Enabled
}
```

The code is calling the feature flag server by getting each key that we are interested in. So, in the case of the sample, we are calling using the following URLs:

```markup
http://localhost:8080/features/servicea
http://localhost:8080/features/serviceb
```

For example, when calling `http://localhost:8080/features/servicea`, the code will get the following JSON response from the feature flag server:

```markup
{
  "key": "servicea",
  "enabled": true,
  "users": [],
  "groups": [
    "dev",
    "admin"
  ],
  "percentage": 0
} 
```

The `checkFlags()` function is interested only in the `enabled` field, which will be unmarshalled into the `FeatureFlagServerResponse` struct as shown below:

```markup
func checkFlags(key string) bool {
  type FeatureFlagServerResponse struct {
     Enabled bool `json:"enabled"`
  }
  ...
  var f FeatureFlagServerResponse
  err = json.Unmarshal(resBody, &f)
  ...
}
```

After successfully converting the JSON to a struct, it will return the `Enabled` value as shown here:

```markup
func checkFlags(key string) bool {
  ...
  return f.Enabled
}
```

We have come to the end of the chapter. In this section, we looked at integrating the feature flag in different scenarios such as inside web applications as well as using it as a feature toggle for accessing different microservices. There are other use cases where feature flags can be used, such as enabling/disabling performance metrics in production and enabling tracing in production for troubleshooting bugs.

# Summary

In this chapter, we learned about feature flags, including what they are used for and how to use them. We learned how to install a simple feature flag server and saw how to integrate it with our sample application.

We went through the steps of using feature flags in two different use cases – integrating it by checking on the flag to enable/disable a button in our frontend and in the backend to call different microservices. Using feature flags to enable or disable certain services gives the application flexibility on what response will be sent back to the frontend, which gives developers the ability to allow access to certain services as and when needed.

In the next chapter, we will look at building continuous integration by exploring the different features provided by GitHub.
