# Session Management

In [_Chapter 9_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184)_, Tailwind, Middleware, and CORS_, we created a full-stack app with an independent frontend and backend talking to each other via an API.

In this chapter, we’ll bring all of our existing knowledge together, introduce how to create and validate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for session management and middleware, set up the basic tenets of using Vue Router with navigation guards, and learn about errors and “catch-all” navigation guards.

We’ll cover the following topics in this chapter:

-   Session management and JWTs
-   (Re)introducing Vue Router
-   Navigation guards
-   Defaults and error pages

By the end of this chapter, we’ll have an understanding of how to complete and secure a project ready for our waiting users.

# Session management and JWTs

We looked at session management using cookies previously in [_Chapter 6_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093), Moving to API-First, using the Gorilla Mux middleware. In our app, we created an in-memory cookie store via the functionality provided by Gorilla sessions: [https://github.com/gorilla/sessions](https://github.com/gorilla/sessions).

We previously implemented our middleware to validate that our user was approved by encoding two values – a user ID we looked up from the database and a `userAuthenticated` Boolean value. This worked well for our use case, but our implementation meant that every call to our API backend required a round trip to the database to check that the user ID was still present, before letting the call continue.

![Figure 10.1: An illustration of login and save API workflows using a session cookie](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_10.01_B18295.jpg)

Figure 10.1: An illustration of login and save API workflows using a session cookie

This approach is fine and the Gorilla sessions library provides a number of alternative backends to speed things up, such as using Redis and SQLite, but we’re going to look at an alternative approach using JWTs.

## What’s a JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. A JWT is a standard for creating data with optional signatures (public or public/private) and/or encryption, with a payload consisting of JSON that asserts a number of what the JWT specification calls claims. You can generate and examine JWTs on the web at `jwt.io`, and these are broken down into three parts, consisting of the header, the payload (with the claims), and the signature. These are then base64-encoded and concatenated together using a . separator, which you can see here.

![Figure 10.2: Color-coded illustration showing the parts of a JWT](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_10.02_B18295.jpg)

Figure 10.2: Color-coded illustration showing the parts of a JWT

The part that is of interest to us is the payload and the claims. A number of reserved claims exist that we should respect as part of the specification, which are as follows:

-   **iss** (**issuer**): The issuer of the JWT.
-   **sub** (**subject**): The subject of the JWT (the user).
-   **aud** (**audience**): The recipient for which the JWT is intended.
-   **exp** (**expiration time**): The time after which the JWT expires.
-   **nbf** (**not before time**): The time before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing.
-   **iat** (**issued at time**): The time at which the JWT was issued. This can be used to determine the age of the JWT.
-   **jti** (**JWT ID**): A unique identifier. This can be used to prevent the JWT from being replayed (allows a token to be used only once).

In the library, we’re going to use `go-jwt`, available at [https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt). These standard claims are provided via a Go struct, as shown here:

```markup
// Structured version of Claims Section, as referenced at
// https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1
type StandardClaims struct {
    Audience  string `json:"aud,omitempty"`
    ExpiresAt int64  `json:"exp,omitempty"`
    Id        string `json:"jti,omitempty"`
    IssuedAt  int64  `json:"iat,omitempty"`
    Issuer    string `json:"iss,omitempty"`
    NotBefore int64  `json:"nbf,omitempty"`
    Subject   string `json:"sub,omitempty"`
}
```

We can add to these claims to provide our own additional claims, and in typical Go style, we do so by embedding `StandardClaims` into our own struct, which I’ve called `MyCustomClaims`, as shown here:

```markup
    mySigningKey := []byte("ImaginePub")
    // Your claims above and beyond the default
    type MyCustomClaims struct {
        Foo string `json:"foo"`
        jwt.StandardClaims
    }
    // Create the Claims
    claims := MyCustomClaims{
        "bar",
        // Note we embed the standard claims here
        jwt.StandardClaims{
            ExpiresAt: time.Now().Add(time.Minute *
                                      1).Unix(),
            Issuer:    "FullStackGo",
        },
    }
    // Encode to token
    token := jwt.NewWithClaims(jwt.SigningMethodHS256,
                               claims)
    tokenString, err := token.SignedString(mySigningKey)
    fmt.Printf("Your JWT as a string is %v\n", tokenString)
```

If you execute this code, you will get the following output:

```markup
$ go run chapter10/jwt-example.go
Your JWT as a string is eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.ey Jmb28iOiJiYXIiLCJleHAiOjE2NTY3MzY2NDIsImlzcyI6IkZ1bGxTdGFja0dv In0.o4YUzyw1BUukYg5H6CP_nz9gAmI2AylvNXG0YC5OE0M
```

When you run the sample code or write your own, it will look slightly different because of the relative expiration in `StandardClaims`, and if you tried decoding the preceding string, chances are that it will show as expired by quite a few seconds!

You may be asking why you should care about JWTs when you've already seen your database-based middleware working. The reason is that we can save a round trip to our database, saving us time and bandwidth.

Because JWTs are signed, we can confidently assume that the provided claims can be asserted to be true so long as the JWT is decoded as we expect. With our JWT-based model, we can instead encode the user details and permissions into the claims on the JWT itself.

![Figure 10.3: An illustration of login and save API workflows using a JWT secured session](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_10.03_B18295.jpg)

Figure 10.3: An illustration of login and save API workflows using a JWT secured session

This all seems great, but there are a number of “gotchas” when working with JWTs, and it’s worth covering them before we start using them in every situation.

### The “none algorithm” gotcha

An unsecured JWT can be created where the “`alg`” header parameter value is set to “`none`” with an empty string for its signature value.

Given that our JWTs are simply base64-encoded payloads, a malicious hacker could decode our JWT, strip off the signature, change the alg parameter to “none” and try to present it back to our API as a valid JWT.

```markup
$ Pipe our encoded JWT through the base64 command to decode it
$ echo eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9 | base64 -D
{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}
$ echo '{"alg":"none","typ":"JWT"}' | base64
eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0K
```

It’s important that the library you’re using verifies that you’re receiving your JWTs back with the same alg you provided, and you should verify this yourself before using it.

### The “logout” gotcha

When you click to log out of your web app, the common thing to do is to set the cookie expiration to a date in the past, and then the browser will delete the cookie. You should also remove any active session information from your database and/or app. The issue is that with JWTs, it may not work how you expect it to. Because a JWT is self-contained, it will continue to work and be considered valid until it expires – the JWT expiration, not that of the cookie – so if someone were to intercept your JWT, they could continue to access the platform until the JWT expired.

### The “banlist” or “stale data” gotcha

Similar to the logout gotcha, because our JWTs are self-contained, the data stored in them can be stale until refreshed. This can manifest as access rights/permissions becoming out of sync or, worse still, someone being able to continue to log in to your application after you’ve banned them. This is worse in scenarios where you need to be able to block a user in real time – for example, in situations of abuse or poor behavior. Instead, with the JWT model, the user will continue to have access until the token expires.

### Using JWTs with cookies and our middleware

With all of our previous gotchas understood, we’re going to write some simple middleware and cookie handling to build on our simple API service from [_Chapter 9_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184), Tailwind, Middleware, and CORS, combining it with our knowledge from [_Chapter 5_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor070)_, Securing the Backend_ _and Middleware_.

This code is all provided on GitHub under `chapter10/simple-backend`.

### Setting cookies and validation middleware

In order to start using our new JWTs, we’re going to write some middleware for the mux to consume that we will inject into all our protected routes. As before, we’re using a signature that the default library uses, where we take in `http.Handler` and return `handlerFunc`. When successful, we call `next.ServerHTTP(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request`) to continue and indicate the successful handling of a request:

```markup
// JWTProtectedMiddleware verifies a valid JWT exists in
// our cookie and if not, encourages the consumer to login
// again.
func JWTProtectedMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter,
                                 r *http.Request) {
        // Grab jwt-token cookie
        jwtCookie, err := r.Cookie("jwt-token")
        if err != nil {
            log.Println("Error occurred reading cookie", err)
            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
            json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(struct {
                Message string `json:"message,omitempty"`
            }{
                Message: "Your session is not valid –
                          please login",
            })
            return
        }
        // Decode and validate JWT if there is one
        userEmail, err := decodeJWTToUser(jwtCookie.Value)
        if userEmail == "" || err != nil {
            log.Println("Error decoding token", err)
            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
            json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(struct {
                Message string `json:"message,omitempty"`
            }{
                Message: "Your session is not valid –
                          please login",
            })
            return
        }
        // If it's good, update the expiry time
        freshToken := createJWTTokenForUser(userEmail)
        // Set the new cookie and continue into the handler
        w.Header().Add("Content-Type", "application/json")
        http.SetCookie(w, authCookie(freshToken))
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

This code is checking for our cookie, named `jwt-token`, and decodes it with our new `decodeJWTToUser`, checking the value for a valid entry. In our case, we expect `userEmail`, and if it is not present, we simply return an invalid session message. In this example, we then update the expiry time for the JWT and exit the function after setting the latest cookie.

In practice, we would check more strictly to ensure that a small window is kept for valid claims, and we’d then go back to the database to check whether the user still had permission to access our platform.

The functionality we use for setup and manipulation of our cookies is very similar to our previous work in [_Chapter 5_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor070)_, Securing the Backend and Middleware_ including with the domain, same-site mode, and, most importantly, HttpOnly and Secure.

We use Secure as good practice to ensure that it’s only ever sent via secure HTTPS (except on localhost for development) as, although we can be confident our JWT is secure, it can still be decoded with tools such as jwt.io:

```markup
var jwtSigningKey []byte
var defaultCookie http.Cookie
var jwtSessionLength time.Duration
var jwtSigningMethod = jwt.SigningMethodHS256
func init() {
    jwtSigningKey = []byte(env.GetAsString(
      "JWT_SIGNING_KEY", "ImaginePub"))
    defaultSecureCookie = http.Cookie{
        HttpOnly: true,
        SameSite: http.SameSiteLaxMode,
        Domain:   env.GetAsString("COOKIE_DOMAIN",
                                  "localhost"),
        Secure:   env.GetAsBool("COOKIE_SECURE", true),
    }
    jwtSessionLength = time.Duration(env.GetAsInt(
      "JWT_SESSION_LENGTH", 5))
}
...
func authCookie(token string) *http.Cookie {
    d := defaultSecureCookie
    d.Name = "jwt-token"
    d.Value = token
    d.Path = "/"
    return &d
}
func expiredAuthCookie() *http.Cookie {
    d := defaultSecureCookie
    d.Name = "jwt-token"
    d.Value = ""
    d.Path = "/"
    d.MaxAge = -1
      // set our expiration to some date in the distant
      // past
    d.Expires = time.Date(1983, 7, 26, 20, 34, 58,
                          651387237, time.UTC)
    return &d
}
```

The `HttpOnly` flag is used for us in our cookie package and hasn’t been mentioned before – so, what is it?

Well, by default, when we don’t use `HttpOnly`, our frontend Javascript can read and inspect cookie values. This is useful for setting a temporary state via the frontend and for storing a state that the frontend needs to manipulate. This is fine for a number of scenarios, and your application may have a combination of cookie-handling techniques.

When you use `HttpOnly`, the browser prevents access to the cookie, typically returning an empty string as the result of any values read. This is useful for preventing **Cross-Site Scripting** (**XSS**), where malicious sites try to access your values, and prevents you from sending data to a third-party/attacker’s website.

This doesn’t prevent us from logging in (which wouldn’t be very helpful!). All our API/backend requests can still be performed with all cookies, but we do need to tell our frontend application to do so.

After providing the ability to log in with these additions to our backend, we’re now going to revisit routing so that we can move around within our app.

# (Re)introducing Vue Router

Before we dive in, we need to quickly refresh our understanding of how our frontend and backend communicate and ensure that we know how things work.

You may recall from [_Chapter 9_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184), _Tailwind, Middleware, and CORS_ that we set up our `axios` instance (under `src/lib/api.js`). With a few defaults, this is where the `withCredentials` value comes into play:

```markup
export default axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_API_URL,
  withCredentials: true,
  transformRequest: [...axios.defaults.transformRequest,
                     transformSnakeCase],
  transformResponse: [...axios.defaults.transformResponse,
                      transformCamelCase],
});
```

We want to ensure that all our hard work with the Secure and `HttpOnly` cookies is preserved when the frontend and backend communicate, and `withCredentials` ensures that all requests to the backend should be made, complete with cookies, auth headers, and so on.

We’re going to be building on this `axios` instance as we introduce the concept of navigation guards. What we’re going to do before we navigate around our application is fetch/refresh our data from the backend before rendering. This gives us the ability to check whether users should be looking at certain pages, whether they need to be logged in, or whether they shouldn’t be snooping!

With our app now passing our cookies into every request, we can now move into utilizing permissions as we navigate our app using navigation guards.

# Navigation guards

Navigation guards in Vue are fundamental for logged-in users. As with any core functionality of Vue, it’s worth diving into the amazing documentation provided by the Vue team here: [https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html).

A navigation guard is, as the name suggests, a way to cancel or reroute users depending on the results of certain guard rails checks. They can be installed globally – for example, everything is behind a login/paywall – or they can be placed on individual routes.

They are called on a navigation request, in order, and before a component is loaded. They can also be used to retrieve props to be provided to the next pages components and use the syntax of `router.beforeEach` (**to, from**).

Previous versions also provided a `next` parameter, but this has been deprecated and shouldn’t be used in modern code.

The functionality of a navigation guard is as follows:

-   `to`: Provides the target location, where the user is trying to navigate to
-   `from`: The current location where the user is coming from

The job of the guard handler is to assess whether to allow navigation or not.

The handler can do this by returning `false`, a new route location, which is used to manipulate the browser history via a `router.push(``)` to allow additional props, or simply `true` to indicate the navigation is allowed.

Using a simple example from the docs, we can install a global navigation guard on our routes to check the value of the `isAuthenticated` variable before navigating:

```markup
router.beforeEach(async (to, from) => {
  if (
    // make sure the user is authenticated
    !isAuthenticated &&
    // Avoid an infinite redirect
    to.name !== 'Login'
  ) {
    // redirect the user to the login page
    return { name: 'Login' }
  }
  // Otherwise navigation succeeds to 'from'
})
```

Putting the logic into each route can be a bit ugly. What we will do is expose an endpoint in the backend that returns either a value or even just a 20x HTTP successful response, check for this in our middleware, and if that works, we will allow navigation.

In the following code, we’ve got an endpoint, `/profile`, exposed on our backend. This can return data or, in this simple case, just a 200/OK response, and we can check that with our `getCheckLogin(`) function.

Our `checkAuth(`) function now checks a meta value for an optional Boolean value called `requiresAuth`. If there’s no authorization required, we navigate successfully; otherwise, we try to access our endpoint. If there’s an error (non-successful) request, we redirect to our login page; otherwise, we allow the navigation to continue:

```markup
export function getCheckLogin() {
  return api.get('/profile');
}
export default function checkAuth() {
  return async function checkAuthOrRedirect(to, from) {
    if (!to?.meta?.requiresAuth) {
      // non protected route, allow it
      return;
    }
    try {
      const { data } = await getCheckLogin();
      return;
    } catch (error) {
      return { name: 'Login'};
    }
  };
}
```

These checks can be as complicated as we want in our navigation guards, but remember that you’re calling these on every navigation. You might want to look at state management if you find yourself doing this a lot, such as Pinia (Vue 3) or Vuex (if you’re using Vue 2).

To install these checks and values, we simply install the global handler, and for protected routes, we provide the `meta` Boolean. This is shown in the following code snippet:

```markup
...
const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(import.meta.env.BASE_URL),
  routes: [
{
    path: '/login',
    Name: 'Login',
    meta: {
      requiresAuth: false,
    },
    props: true,
    component: () => import('@/views/login.vue'),
  },{
    path: '/dashboard,
    Name: 'Dashboard',
    meta: {
      requiresAuth: true,
    },
    props: true,
    component: () => import('@/views/dashboard.vue'),
  }]
});
...
router.beforeEach(checkAuth());
```

Meta fields are a useful feature. They allow us to attach arbitrary information to our routes, in our situation we’re using the meta information as an indicator to check the authorization. You can find out more about meta here: [https://v3.router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/meta.html](https://v3.router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/meta.html).

With the ability to provide for logged-in and logged-out statuses, we now have a functioning app. One final thing to really polish our app is to provide default and error pages for our users if our app goes wrong or if they land on the wrong page in it.

# Defaults and error pages

With our application now securely communicating to the backend and routing correctly based on authorization, we are almost finished with our core functional requirements.

There’s one final scenario that may arise for our users – the dreaded 404 – the page not found error! Thankfully, Vue Router makes it easy to create a wildcarded “catch-all” route that will be set to redirect users to a specific page if they navigate to somewhere that doesn’t exist.

As you know, in Vue, all routes are defined by creating rules on the specific URL path. So, for example, creating a route for a path of `/user` would be caught if the user entered packt.com/user, but it wouldn’t if the user entered `packt.com/my-user` or any other word that is not precisely the one set in the path rule.

To define our catch-all rule in version 4 of the Vue `routervue`\-router 4, we will use the following route entry:

```markup
{ path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*', name: 'not-found', component: NotFound }
```

We will inject this as the final route in our `router.routes`. The wildcard at the end of the path match means we can navigate to this page and catch the expected route. Alternatively, if that’s too much magic, you can use `path: ‘/*’` and don’t need to worry about catching the intended route.

The best practice for a 404 page not found error would be to provide hints of what went wrong and give the user a way to get home or navigate to a similar page, but that’s a choice you can make for your `NotFound` component.

# Summary

Excitedly, we’ve now got enough knowledge to complete the development of our full-stack app. In this chapter, we introduced JWT-based tokens, talked about when and why to use them, and covered a few “gotchas.” We then revisited cookie handling between our front and backend parts before, finally, moving on to Vue Router.

Closing off the chapter with Vue Router, we looked at adding navigation guards, looked at how we can use meta values to enhance our development experience and mark pages for authorization, before finishing off by setting up our catch-all error-handling route so that our users have a great experience.

In the next chapters, we’ll look at getting our app into production and getting ready for our first users.
