# Frontend Frameworks

In this chapter, we will take a high-level look at the current JavaScript frameworks available to modern web developers. We will compare some of the popular ones, Svelte, React, and Vue, before creating a simple app in Vue and ending by adding navigation using the popular Vue Router. This will lay the foundations needed to later talk to our API server from [_Chapter 6_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093), _Moving_ _to API-First_.

Upon completion of this chapter, we will have covered the following:

-   Understanding the difference between server-side rendering and single-page applications
-   Looking at different frontend frameworks
-   Creating applications using the Vue framework
-   Understanding routing inside the Vue framework

This chapter paves the way to the land of the frontend. We will learn about the different parts of frontend development in this and the next chapters.

# Server-side rendering versus single-page apps

In [_Chapter 4_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053), _Serving and Embedding HTML Content_, we created our app as a server-side rendered app. What this means is that all of the content and assets, including the HTML, are generated on the backend and sent on each page request. There’s nothing wrong with this; our publisher, ImagineDevOps , uses **server-side rendering** (**SSR**) for its own site at [https://www.imaginedevops.io/](https://www.imaginedevops.io/). SSR as a technique is used by technologies such as WordPress and many other sites that host content that changes less frequently and may have less interactivity.

The alternative to SSR we’re going to use for our app is **client-side rendering** (**CSR**). CSR works by having the client fetch the app as a _bundle_ of JavaScript and other assets, executing the JavaScript and the app dynamically, and binding to an element that takes over the page rendering. The app creates and renders each route dynamically in the browser. This is all done without requiring any reloading of the bundle or content.

By moving to client-side rendering, it improves the app's interactivity and responsiveness by allowing it to manipulate the document model, fetch additional content and data via the API, and generally perform closer to what a user might expect from a desktop app without constant page reloads.

When we talk about reactivity, we’re describing the situation in which changes in the application state are automatically reflected in the **document object model** (**DOM**). This is a key attribute of all of the frameworks we’ll be exploring in this chapter, including React, Vue, and Svelte.

Just Imagine

# Introducing React, Vue, and more

If there’s one thing that the JavaScript community enjoys doing, it’s creating new frameworks!

We’re going to explore and contrast a few of the most popular ones and look at the common parts they all share and the main points of difference.

## React

React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries available. It was created, and is still maintained, by Meta (formerly Facebook) and was inspired heavily by a predecessor used internally within Facebook for creating PHP components.

React uses the **JavaScript Syntax eXtension** (**JSX**) as a syntax, which looks like a combination of HTML and Java Script. Although you can use React without compilation, most React developers are used to the process common to most modern frameworks, which is to combine and build the source files, the `.jsx` and `.vue` files, and build them into a final bundle that can be deployed as a static file. We’ll look at this in a later chapter.

![Figure 7.1: Modern JavaScript SPA build process](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_7.01_B18295.jpg)

Figure 7.1: Modern JavaScript SPA build process

React is a very popular option for creating apps and one of its strengths is the fact that there are a number of different options to choose from when building your app, such as Redux, Flux, BrowserRouter, or React Router. This flexibility is great but can cause conflict and strong opinions on the “one true way.” The React team avoids this issue by continually calling out that React is a library, not a framework, so choosing the components of your app is down to the individual.

React is similar to other frameworks in that it has a full life cycle model that can be “hooked” at runtime to override defaults (for example, `render` and `shouldComponentUpdate`).

## Svelte

Svelte straddles an interesting middle ground and is included as an alternative to the two heavy hitters of React and Vue. Svelte takes the approach of pushing more into the compilation step, removing the need for techniques such as diffing the virtual DOM to transpile the code into vanilla JavaScript. This approach means less work is done by the browser but it still has a similar build process to both React and Vue for building bundles. Svelte provides its own preferred router, called SvelteKit, but alternatives exist and Svelte can represent a nice, lightweight alternative to the others. Svelte is quite a new project when looking at the more established players and doesn’t have as many resources behind it, but it is still viable for smaller projects.

## Vue

The final framework we’re going to introduce is Vue, which is what we use as our preferred framework for building our frontend application.

The big appeal initially for me was the fact that the previous version of Vue (version 2) could be loaded and run directly via a **content domain network** (**CDN**), which made experimentation and prototyping incredibly easy back in 2016 when it was first released.

Vue offers a very familiar syntax that makes it easy to learn – it separates out the presentation from the logic and the styling, it’s very lightweight, and it uses the concept of **single-file** **components** (**SFCs**).

The concept of SFC makes it incredibly easy to build simple, scoped components that can be reused from project to project without the addition of learning the “not-quite-JavaScript” JSX used by React.

The following code is a simple component that displays a greeting using the Options API. When Vue was first released, it used the Options API by default, but in later iterations, it has moved to include a newer Composition API, which we’ll explore later:

```markup
<template>
  <div>
    <Thing @click="greetLog" />
    <p class="greeting">{{ greeting }}</p>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
import Thing from '@/components/thing.vue';
export default {
  name: 'Greeter',
  components: ['Thing'],
  props:{},
  mounted(){},
  methods: {
    greetLog() {  console.log('Greeter') };
  },
  data() {
    return {
      greeting: 'Hello World!'
    }
  }
}
</script>
<style scoped>
.greeting {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
```

**Example of a** **SFC Greeter.vue**

As you can see in the preceding code block, the approach of Vue’s SFC design has three parts: the HTML, the JavaScript, and the style (usually CSS, often “scoped”). This means you can combine the HTML`-esque` style of the `<template>` with small Vue-specific additions, such as `@click="functionName"`, to easily create our components. The `@click` annotation featured here, which looks close to HTML, is the syntax used by Vue to extend and bind HTML events to our objects – in this case, replacing the native `onClick` attribute.

The `<script>` contained instance includes a name; props, used to provide properties to the component from parents; `mounted()`, a function called when the component is first added to the DOM; components, that is, the components being imported for use by the component; assorted other methods; and finally, the `data()` object, which can hold our components' state.

The final part of the SFC is the `<style>` part – we can specify non-CSS languages here. For example, we could use `lang="scss"` if we wanted to use SCSS rather than CSS. We can also add the `scoped` keyword, which means that Vue will use name mangling to ensure that our CSS styles are scoped only to this component instance.

A final benefit of using Vue is the opinionated approach taken to build tools (preferring to create Vite, which leverages the incredibly fast esbuild to reduce bundle build times to milliseconds compared to the slower React), component layout, and routers (Vue Router), which we’ll explore in later chapters. The opinionated nature of Vue works nicely with the opinionated nature of Golang itself, which helps remove a lot of debate on which approach and components to choose to build your app, ensuring that when you bring in more team members and hand over your successful full stack app, you can be safe in the knowledge that another Vue developer wouldn’t argue with you on how you did it, nor on the technology chosen – mainly as they would’ve chosen the same!

So far in this section, we have looked at what the Vue framework is all about. In the next section, we will learn by creating some simple apps using the Vue framework.

Just Imagine

# Creating a Vue app

In the previous section, we discussed different frontend frameworks, so for this section, we are going to try to use Vue to build our frontend. In this section, we will look at writing our UI in Vue and discuss how we migrate the login page to Vue. This section will not teach you how to use Vue but rather will look at the way we use Vue to write the frontend components for our sample application.

Just Imagine

# Application and components

When writing software using Vue, the application will start up by creating an application instance. This instance is the main object in our Vue-based application. Once we have an instance, then we can start using components. Components are reusable UI pieces that contain three parts – a template (which is like HTML), styles, and JavaScript. Normally, when designing a frontend, we think about HTML elements – div, href, and so on – but now we need to think about components that contain all the different parts. _Figure 7__.2_ shows an example of the login page that we rewrite using Vue.

![Figure 7.2: Vue-based login](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_7.02_B18295.jpg)

Figure 7.2: Vue-based login

The concept of an application inside Vue can be thought of as a self-isolated container containing different components that can share data. Any web page can contain a number of applications displaying different kinds of data, and even if they are isolated, they can also share data if and when required.

## Login page using Vue

In this section, we will look at how we use the login page as is without converting it into a component and use it as a Vue application rendered by the browser. We need to install the dependencies first by running the following command:

```markup
npm install
```

This will install all the different dependencies, including the `http-server` module, which we will be using to serve the login page. Start the server by running the following command, making sure you are inside the `chapter7/login` directory:

```markup
npm run start
```

You will see the output shown in _Figure 7__.3_:

![Figure 7.3: Serving using http-server](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_7.03_B18295.jpg)

Figure 7.3: Serving using http-server

Open your browser and type http://127.0.0.1:3000/login.html into the address bar, and you will see the login page.

Let’s dig through the code and see how it works together. The following snippet inside `login.html` shows the application initialization code:

```markup
<script type="module">
   import {createApp} from 'vue'
   const app = createApp({
       data() {
           return {
               loginText: 'Login to your account',
               ...
           }
       },
       methods: {
           handleSubmit: function () {
               ...
           }
       }
   }).mount('#app')
</script>
```

The code imports `createApp` from the Vue library and uses it to create an application that contains `data()` and `methods` used inside the page. The `data()` block declares the variables that will be used inside the page while `methods` contains functions used. The application is mounted into the element with the ID “app” app, in this case, the `<div>` with `id=app`.

The following code snippet shows the part of the page that uses the data:

```markup
<body class="bg-gray-900">
           ...
               <p class="text-xs text-gray-50">{{ loginText
                 }}</p>
           ...
               <p class="text-xs text-gray-50">
                 {{ emailText }}</p>
           ...
               <p class="text-xs font-bold text-white">
                 {{ passwordText }}</p>
               ...
</body>
```

The variable inside the curly brackets (`{{}}`) will be populated with the data defined previously when we initialize the application.

The following code snippet shows the part of the page that uses the `handleSubmit` function:

```markup
<body class="bg-gray-900">
                   ...
               <button @click="handleSubmit"
                       class="px-4 pt-2 pb-2.5 w-full
                              rounded-lg bg-red-500
                              hover:bg-red-600">
                   ...
</body>
```

`@click` on the button element will trigger the function that was defined when creating the Vue application object, which will write to the console log the data in the username field.

## Using Vite

Referring back to _Figure 7__.1_, one of the parts of the build process is that of the bundler. In this section, we will look at Vite, which is a bundler for Vue. What is a bundler? It is a build tool that combines all your different assets (HTML, CSS, and so on) into one file, making it easy for distribution.

In the previous section, we linked to a CDN-hosted version of the Vue runtime. In this section, we’ll be using Vite to build our application and generate our bundled code.

Vite – French for “quick” – was built by the same team behind Vue itself and was designed to provide a faster development experience with extremely fast hot reload and combine it with a powerful build stage that transpiles, minifies, and bundles your code into optimized static assets ready for deployment. Refer back to _Figure 7__.1_ to see all the stages used to build SPAs.

In this section, we will look at writing our login page as a component and using it as a Vue application rendered by the browser. The code can be seen inside the `chapter7/npmvue` folder.

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```markup
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the server is up and running, you will get the output shown in _Figure 7__.4_.

![Figure 7.4: Vite server output](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_7.04_B18295.jpg)

Figure 7.4: Vite server output

Open the browser and access the login page by entering `http://localhost:3000` into the address bar. Let’s investigate further and look at how the code is structured. We will start by looking at the `index.html` page, as shown in the following snippet:

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>
   ...
 </head>
 <body>
   <div id="app"></div>
   <script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
 </body>
</html>
```

The preceding `index.html` references the `main.js` script, which is how we inject the Vue initialization code.

The `<div..>` declaration is where the application will be mounted when rendered in the browser, and the page also includes a script found in `src/main.js`.

`main.js` contains the Vue application initialization code, as shown:

```markup
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
createApp(App).mount('#app')
```

`createApp` will create an application using the `App` object imported from `App.vue`, which will be the starting component for our application. Vue-related code is normally stored inside a file with the `.vue` extension. The `App.vue` file acts as an app container that hosts the components that it will use. In this case, it will use the `Login` component, as shown in the following snippet:

```markup
<script setup>
import Login from './components/Login.vue'
</script>
<template>
   <Login />
</template>
```

The `<script setup>` tag is known as the Composition API, which is a set of APIs that allows Vue components to be imported. In our case, we are importing the components from the `Login.vue` file.

The code imports the `Login.Vue` file as a component and uses it inside the `<template>` block. Looking at the `Login.vue` file, you will see that it contains the HTML elements to create the login page.

The `Login.vue` snippet can be seen in the following code block:

```markup
<script>
export default {
 data() {
   return {
     loginText: 'Login to your account',
     ...
   }
 },
 methods: {
   handleSubmit: function () {
     ...
   }
 }
}
</script>
<style>
@import "../assets/minified.css";
</style>
<template>
   ...
       <button @click="handleSubmit"
               class="px-4 pt-2 pb-2.5 w-full rounded-lg
                      bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600">
     ...
</template>
```

The class used for the button in the preceding example is declared inside a `minified.css` file inside the `assets` folder.

We have learned how to create apps using the Vue framework and wired all the different components together. We also looked at how to use the Vite tool to write a Vue-based application. In the next section, we will look at routing requests to different Vue components.

Just Imagine

# Using Vue Router to move around

In this section, we will look at Vue Router and learn how to use it. Vue Router helps in structuring the frontend code when designing a **single-page application** (**SPA**). An SPA is a web application that is presented to the user as a single HTML page, which makes it more responsive as the content inside the HTML page is updated without refreshing the page. The SPA requires the use of a router that will route to the different endpoints when updating data from the backend.

Using a router allows easier mapping between the URL path and components simulating page navigation. There are two types of routes that can be configured using Vue Router – dynamic and static routes. Dynamic routes are used when the URL path is dynamic based on some kind of data. For example, in `/users/:id`, `id` in the path will be populated with a value, which will be something such as `/users/johnny` or `users/acme`. Static routes are routes that do not contain any dynamic data, for example, `/users` or `/orders`.

In this section, we will look at static routes. The examples for this section can be found in the `chapter7/router` folder. Run the following command from the `router` folder to run the sample application:

```markup
npm install
npm run server
```

The command will run a server listening on port `8080`. Open your browser and enter `http://localhost:8080` in the address bar. You will see the output shown in _Figure 7__.5_:

![Figure 7.5: Router sample application](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_7.05_B18295.jpg)

Figure 7.5: Router sample application

The `App.vue` file contains the Vue Router information, which can be seen as follows:

```markup
<template>
 <div id="routerdiv">
   <table>
      ...
         <router-link :to="{ name: 'Home'}">Home
         </router-link>
      ...
         <router-link :to="{ name: 'Login'}">Login
         </router-link>
      ...
   </table>
   <router-view></router-view>
 </div>
</template>
```

The preceding `router-link` route is defined inside `router/index.js`, as shown:

```markup
const routes = [
   {
       path: '/',
       name: 'Home',
       component: Home
   },
   {
       path: '/login',
       name: 'Login',
       component: Login
   },
];
```

The `<router-link/>` tag defines the router configuration that the application has, and in our case, this is pointing to the `Home` and `Login` components declared inside the `index.js` file under the `router` folder, as shown:

```markup
import Vue from 'vue';
import { createRouter, createWebHashHistory } from 'vue-router'
import Home from '../views/Home.vue';
import Login from "../views/Login.vue";
Vue.use(VueRouter);
const routes = [
   {
       path: '/',
       name: 'Home',
       component: Home
   },
   {
       path: '/login',
       name: 'Login',
       component: Login
   },
];
const router = createRouter({
   history: createWebHashHistory(),
   base: process.env.BASE_URL,
   routes
})
export default router
```

Each of the defined routes is mapped to its respective components, which are the `Home` and `Login` components, which can be found inside the `views` folder.

## Routing the login page

We know that the `/login` path is mapped to the `Login` component, which is the same component that we looked at in the previous section, _Login page using Vue_. The difference in the router example is in the way the script is defined, as shown:

```markup
<template>
 ...
</template>
<script type="module">
export default {
 data() {
   return {
     loginText: 'Login to your account',
     emailText: 'Email Address',
     passwordText: 'Password',
     username: 'enter username',
     password: 'enter password',
   };
 },
 methods: {
   handleSubmit: function () {
     console.log(this.$data.username)
   }
 }
};
</script>
```

Unlike in the previous section, the Vue initialization code has been moved into `main.js`, as shown:

```markup
...
const myApp = createApp(App)
myApp.use(router)
myApp.mount('#app')
```

In this section, we looked at how to restructure the application to work as a SPA by using Vue Router.

# Summary

In this chapter, we learned about Vue and how to structure our frontend to make it easy to transition into components and applications. We looked at the different frontend frameworks and discussed what each of them provides.

We looked at how components and applications work together when writing a Vue-based web page. We tested what we learned by migrating the login page that we created as a simple HTML page to a Vue-based application. Lastly, we learned about Vue Router and how to use it to make it easier to route to different parts of a SPA.

Taking on board all this learning, in the next chapter, we will look at writing our application as a Vue- based application that will communicate with the REST API that we have built.
