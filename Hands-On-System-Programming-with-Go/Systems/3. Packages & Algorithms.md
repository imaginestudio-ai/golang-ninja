# Go Packages, Algorithms, and Data Structures

The main topics of this chapter will be Go packages, algorithms, and data structures. If you combine all of these, you will end up with a complete program because Go programs come in packages that contain algorithms that deal with data structures. These packages include both the ones that come with Go and the ones that you create on your own in order to manipulate your data.

Hence, in this chapter, you will learn about the following:

-   The Big O notation
-   Two sorting algorithms
-   The sort.Slice() function
-   Linked lists
-   Trees
-   Creating your own hash table data structure in Go
-   Go packages
-   **Garbage collection** (**GC**) in Go

# About algorithms

Knowing about algorithms and the way they work will definitely help you when you have to manipulate lots of data. Additionally, if you choose to use the wrong algorithm for a given job, you might slow down the entire process and make your software unusable.

Traditional Unix command-line utilities such as awk(1), sed(1), vi(1), tar(1), and cp(1) are great examples of how good algorithms can help, and these utilities can work with files that are much bigger than the memory of a machine. This was extremely important in the early Unix days because the total amount of RAM on a Unix machine then was about 64K or even less!

# The Big O notation

The **Big O** **notation** is used for describing the complexity of an algorithm, which is directly related to its performance. The efficiency of an algorithm is judged by its computation complexity, which mainly has to do with the number of times the algorithm needs to access its input data to do its job. Usually, you would want to know about the worst-case scenario and the average situation.

So, an O(n) algorithm, where n is the size of the input, is considered better than an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm, which is better than an O(n<sup>3</sup>) algorithm. However, the worst algorithms are the ones with an O(n!) running time because this makes them almost unusable for inputs with more than 300 elements. Note that the Big O notation is more about estimating and not about giving an exact value. Therefore, it is largely used as a comparative value and not an absolute value.

Also, most Go lookup operations in built-in types, such as finding the value of a map key or accessing an array element, have a constant time, which is represented by O(1). This means that built-in types are generally faster than custom types and that you should usually prefer them unless you want full control over what is going on behind the scenes. Additionally, not all data structures are created equal. Generally speaking, array operations are faster than map operations, whereas maps are more versatile than arrays!

Just Imagine

# Sorting algorithms

The most common category of algorithm has to deal with sorting data, that is, placing it in a given order. The two most famous sorting algorithms are the following:

-   **Quicksort**: This is considered one of the fastest sorting algorithms. The average time that quicksort takes to sort its data is O (n log n), but this can grow up to O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst-case scenario, which mainly has to do with the way the data is presented for processing.
-   **Bubble sort**: This algorithm is pretty easy to implement with an O(n<sup>2</sup>) average complexity. If you want to start learning about sorting, start with bubble sort before looking into the more difficult to develop algorithms.

Although every algorithm has its disadvantages, if you do not have lots of data, the algorithm is not really important as long as it does the job.

What you should remember is, the way Go implements sorting internally cannot be controlled by the developer and it can change in the future; so, if you want to have full control over sorting, you should write your own implementation.

# The sort.Slice() function

This section will illustrate the use of the sort.Slice() function that first came with Go version 1.8. The use of the function will be illustrated in sortSlice.go, which will be presented in three parts.

The first part is the expected preamble of the program and the definition of a new structure type, given as follows:

```markup
package main 
 
import ( 
   "fmt" 
   "sort" 
) 
 
type aStructure struct { 
   person string 
   height int 
   weight int 
} 
```

As you might expect, you have to import the sort package to be able to use its Slice() function.

The second part contains the definition of a slice, which has four elements:

```markup
func main() { 
 
   mySlice := make([]aStructure, 0) 
   a := aStructure{"Mihalis", 180, 90} 
   mySlice = append(mySlice, a) 
   a = aStructure{"Dimitris", 180, 95} 
   mySlice = append(mySlice, a) 
   a = aStructure{"Marietta", 155, 45} 
   mySlice = append(mySlice, a) 
   a = aStructure{"Bill", 134, 40} 
   mySlice = append(mySlice, a)
```

Therefore, in the first part, you declared a slice of structure that will be sorted in two ways in the rest of the program, which contains the following code:

```markup
   fmt.Println("0:", mySlice) 
   sort.Slice(mySlice, func(i, j int) bool { 
         return mySlice[i].weight <mySlice[j].weight 
   }) 
   fmt.Println("<:", mySlice) 
   sort.Slice(mySlice, func(i, j int) bool { 
         return mySlice[i].weight >mySlice[j].weight 
   }) 
   fmt.Println(">:", mySlice) 
} 
```

This code contains all the magic: you only have to define the way you want to sort your slice and the rest is done by Go. The sort.Slice() function takes the anonymous sorting function as one of its arguments; the other argument is the name of the slice variable you want to sort. Note that the sorted slice is saved in the slice variable.

Executing sortSlice.go will generate the following output:

```markup
$ go run sortSlice.go
0: [{Mihalis 180 90} {Dimitris 180 95} {Marietta 155 45} {Bill 134 40}]
<: [{Bill 134 40} {Marietta 155 45} {Mihalis 180 90} {Dimitris 180 95}]
>: [{Dimitris 180 95} {Mihalis 180 90} {Marietta 155 45} {Bill 134 40}]
```

As you can see, you can easily sort in ascending or descending order by just changing a single character in the Go code!

Also, if your Go version does not support sort.Slice(), you will get an error message similar to the following:

```markup
$ go version
go version go1.3.3 linux/amd64
$ go run sortSlice.go
# command-line-arguments
./sortSlice.go:27: undefined: sort.Slice
./sortSlice.go:31: undefined: sort.Slice
```

# Linked lists in Go

A **linked list** is a structure with a finite set of elements where each element uses at least two memory locations: one for storing the data and the other for a pointer that links the current element to the next one in the sequence of elements that make the linked list. The biggest advantages of linked lists are that they are easy to understand and implement, and generic enough to be used in many different situations and model many different kinds of data.

The first element of a linked list is called the **head**, whereas the last element of a list is often called the **tail**. The first thing you should do when defining a linked list is to keep the head of the list in a separate variable because the head is the only thing that you need to access the entire linked list.

Note that if you lose the pointer to the first node of a single linked list, there is no possible way to find it again.

The following figure shows the graphical representation of a linked list and a doubly linked list. Doubly linked lists are more flexible, but require more housekeeping:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781787125643/graphics/assets/834e20cc-7099-4649-b740-da9fa61fbd3d.png)

The graphical representation of a linked list and a doubly linked list

So, in this section, we will present a simple implementation of a linked list in Go saved in linkedList.go.

When creating your own data structures, the single most important element is the definition of the node, which is usually implemented using a structure.

The code of linkedList.go will be presented in four parts.

The first part is as follows:

```markup
package main 
 
import ( 
   "fmt" 
) 
```

The second part contains the following Go code:

```markup
type Node struct { 
   Value int 
   Next  *Node 
} 
 
func addNode(t *Node, v int) int { 
   if root == nil { 
         t = &Node{v, nil} 
         root = t 
         return 0 
   } 
 
   if v == t.Value { 
         fmt.Println("Node already exists:", v) 
         return -1 
   } 
 
   if t.Next == nil { 
         t.Next = &Node{v, nil} 
         return -2 
   } 
 
   return addNode(t.Next, v) 
} 
```

Here, you define the structure that will hold each element of the list and a function that allows you to add a new node to the list. In order to avoid duplicate entries, you should check whether a value already exists in the list or not. Note that addNode() is a recursive function because it calls itself and that this approach might be a little slower and require more memory than iterating.

The third part of the code is the traverse() function:

```markup
func traverse(t *Node) { 
   if t == nil { 
         fmt.Println("-> Empty list!") 
         return 
   } 
 
   for t != nil { 
         fmt.Printf("%d -> ", t.Value) 
         t = t.Next 
   } 
   fmt.Println() 
} 
```

The for loop implements the iterative approach for visiting all the nodes in a linked list.

The last part is as follows:

```markup
var root = new(Node)
func main() { 
   fmt.Println(root) 
   root = nil 
   traverse(root) 
   addNode(root, 1) 
   addNode(root, 1) 
   traverse(root) 
   addNode(root, 10) 
   addNode(root, 5) 
   addNode(root, 0) 
   addNode(root, 0) 
   traverse(root) 
   addNode(root, 100) 
   traverse(root) 
}
```

For the first time in this book, you see the use of a global variable that is not a constant. Global variables can be accessed and changed from anywhere in a program, which makes their use both practical and dangerous for that reason. The reason for using a global variable, which is named root, to hold the root of the linked list is to show whether the linked list is empty or not. This happens because integer values in Go are initialized as 0; so new(Node) is in fact {0 <nil>}, which makes it impossible to tell whether the head of the list is nil or not without passing an extra variable to each function that manipulates the linked list.

Executing linkedList.go will generate the following output:

```markup
$ go run linkedList.go
&{0 <nil>}
-> Empty list!
Node already exists: 1
1 ->
Node already exists: 0
1 -> 10 -> 5 -> 0 ->
1 -> 10 -> 5 -> 0 -> 100 ->
```

# Trees in Go

A **graph** is a finite and nonempty set of vertices and edges. A **directed graph** is a graph whose edges have a direction associated with them. A **directed acyclic graph** is a directed graph with no cycles in it. A **tree** is a directed acyclic graph that satisfies three more principles: firstly, it has a root node: the entry point to the tree; secondly, every vertex, except the root, has one and only one entry point; and thirdly, there is a path that connects the root with each vertex and belongs to the tree.

As a result, the root is the first node of the tree. Each node can be connected to one or more nodes depending on the tree type. If each node leads to one and only one other node, then the tree is a linked list!

The most commonly used type of tree is called a binary tree because each node can have up to two children. The following figure shows a graphical representation of a binary tree's data structure:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781787125643/graphics/assets/4f4a000e-6fe7-4025-81f3-ff52adfbd59f.png)

A binary tree

The presented code will only show you how to create a binary tree and how to traverse it in order to print all of its elements as proof that Go can be used for creating a tree data structure. Therefore, it will not implement the full functionality of a binary tree, which also includes deleting a tree node and balancing a tree.

The code of tree.go will be presented in three parts.

The first part is the expected preamble as well as the definition of the node, as given here:

```markup
package main 
 
import ( 
   "fmt" 
   "math/rand" 
   "time" 
) 
type Tree struct { 
   Left  *Tree 
   Value int 
   Right *Tree 
} 
```

The second part contains functions that allow you to traverse a tree in order to print all of its elements, create a tree with randomly generated numbers, and insert a node into it:

```markup
func traverse(t *Tree) { 
   if t == nil { 
         return 
   } 
   traverse(t.Left) 
   fmt.Print(t.Value, " ") 
   traverse(t.Right) 
} 
 
func create(n int) *Tree { 
   var t *Tree 
   rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix()) 
   for i := 0; i< 2*n; i++ { 
         temp := rand.Intn(n) 
         t = insert(t, temp) 
   } 
   return t 
} 
 
func insert(t *Tree, v int) *Tree { 
   if t == nil { 
         return&Tree{nil, v, nil} 
   } 
   if v == t.Value { 
         return t 
   } 
   if v <t.Value { 
         t.Left = insert(t.Left, v) 
         return t 
   } 
   t.Right = insert(t.Right, v) 
   return t 
} 
```

The second if statement of insert() checks whether a value already exists in the tree, in order to not add it again. The third if statement identifies whether the new element will be on the left or right-hand side of the current node.

The last part is the implementation of the main() function:

```markup
func main() { 
   tree := create(30) 
   traverse(tree) 
   fmt.Println() 
   fmt.Println("The value of the root of the tree is", tree.Value) 
} 
```

Executing tree.go will generate the following output:

```markup
$ go run tree.go
0 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
The value of the root of the tree is 16
```

Please note that as the values of the nodes of the tree are generated randomly, the output of the program will be different each time you run it. If you want to get the same elements all the time, then use a constant for the seed value in the create() function.

# Developing a hash table in Go

Strictly speaking, a **hash table** is a data structure that stores one or more key and value pairs and uses the hashFunction of the key to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the correct value can be retrieved. Ideally, the hashFunction should assign each key to a unique bucket, provided that you have the required number of buckets.

A good hashFunction must be able to produce a uniform distribution of hash values because it is inefficient to have unused buckets or big differences in the cardinalities of the buckets. Additionally, the hashFunction should work consistently and output the same hash value for identical keys because otherwise it would be impossible to find the information you want! If you think that hash tables are not that useful, handy, or clever, you should consider the following: when a hash table has _n_ keys and _k_ buckets, its search speed goes from O (n) for a linear search to O (n/k)! Although the improvement might look small, you should realize that for a hash array with only 20 slots, the search time would be reduced by 20 times! This makes hash tables good for applications such as dictionaries or any other analogous application where you have to search lots of data. Although using lots of buckets increases the complexity and the memory usage of your program, there are times when it is worth it.

The following figure shows the graphical representation of a simple hash table with 10 buckets. It is not difficult to understand that the hashFunction is the modulo operator:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781787125643/graphics/assets/30731fad-6b66-43d1-8e49-25ae564255a1.png)

A simple hash table

Although the presented version of a hash table uses numbers because they are a little easier to implement and understand, you can use any data type you want as long as you can find an appropriate hashFunction to process your input. The source code of hash.go will be presented in three parts.

The first one is the following:

```markup
package main 
 
import ( 
   "fmt" 
) 
 
type Node struct { 
   Value int 
   Next  *Node 
} 
 
type HashTablestruct { 
   Table map[int]*Node 
   Size  int 
} 
```

The Node struct definition is taken from the implementation of the linked list you saw earlier. The reason for using a map for the Table variable instead of a slice is that the index of a slice can only be a natural number, whereas the key of a map can be anything.

The second part contains the following Go code:

```markup
func hashFunction(i, size int) int { 
   return (i % size) 
} 
 
func insert(hash *HashTable, value int) int { 
   index := hashFunction(value, hash.Size) 
   element := Node{Value: value, Next: hash.Table[index]} 
   hash.Table[index] = &element 
   return index 
} 
 
func traverse(hash *HashTable) { 
   for k := range hash.Table { 
         if hash.Table[k] != nil { 
               t := hash.Table[k] 
               for t != nil { 
                     fmt.Printf("%d -> ", t.Value) 
                     t = t.Next 
               } 
               fmt.Println() 
         } 
   } 
}
```

Note here that the traverse() function is using the Go code from linkedList.go in order to traverse the elements of each bucket in the hash table. Additionally, note that the insert function does not check whether or not a value already exists in the hash table in order to save book space, but this is not usually the case. Also, for reasons of speed and simplicity, new elements are inserted at the beginning of each list.

The last part contains the implementation of the main() function:

```markup
func main() { 
   table := make(map[int]*Node, 10) 
   hash := &HashTable{Table: table, Size: 10} 
   fmt.Println("Number of spaces:", hash.Size) 
   for i := 0; i< 95; i++ { 
         insert(hash, i) 
   } 
   traverse(hash) 
} 
```

Executing hash.go will generate the following output, which proves that the hash table is working as expected:

```markup
$ go run hash.go
Number of spaces: 1089 -> 79 -> 69 -> 59 -> 49 -> 39 -> 29 -> 19 -> 9 ->86 -> 76 -> 66 -> 56 -> 46 -> 36 -> 26 -> 16 -> 6 ->
92 -> 82 -> 72 -> 62 -> 52 -> 42 -> 32 -> 22 -> 12 -> 2 ->
94 -> 84 -> 74 -> 64 -> 54 -> 44 -> 34 -> 24 -> 14 -> 4 ->
85 -> 75 -> 65 -> 55 -> 45 -> 35 -> 25 -> 15 -> 5 ->
87 -> 77 -> 67 -> 57 -> 47 -> 37 -> 27 -> 17 -> 7 ->
88 -> 78 -> 68 -> 58 -> 48 -> 38 -> 28 -> 18 -> 8 ->
90 -> 80 -> 70 -> 60 -> 50 -> 40 -> 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> 0 ->
91 -> 81 -> 71 -> 61 -> 51 -> 41 -> 31 -> 21 -> 11 -> 1 ->
93 -> 83 -> 73 -> 63 -> 53 -> 43 -> 33 -> 23 -> 13 -> 3 ->
```

If you execute hash.go multiple times, you will see that the order the lines are printed in will vary. This happens because the output of range hash.Table found in the traverse() function cannot be predicted, which happens because Go has an unspecified return order for hashes.

# About Go packages

Packages are for grouping related functions and constants so that you can transfer them easily and use them in your own Go programs. As a result, apart from the main package, packages are not autonomous programs.

There exist many useful Go packages that come with each Go distribution including the following:

-   The net package: This supports portable TCP and UDP connections
-   The http package: This is a part of the net package and offers HTTP server and client implementations
-   The math package: This provides mathematical functions and constants
-   The io package: This deals with primitive input and output operations
-   The os package: This gives you a portable interface to the operating system functionality
-   The time package: This allows you to work with times and dates

For the full list of standard Go packages refer to [https://golang.org/pkg/](https://golang.org/pkg/). I strongly advise you to look into all the packages that come with Go before you start developing your own functions and packages because there is a realistic chance that the functionality you are looking for is already available in a standard Go package.

# Using standard Go packages

You probably already know how to use the standard Go packages. However, what you may not be aware of is the fact that some packages have a structure. So, for example, the net package has several sub directories, named http, mail, rpc, smtp, textproto, and url, which should be imported as net/http, net/mail, net/rpc, net/smtp, net/textproto, and net/url, respectively. Go groups packages when this makes sense, but these packages could have also been isolated packages if they were grouped for distribution instead of functionality.

You can find information about a Go standard package with the help of the godoc utility. So, if you are looking for information about the net package, you should execute godoc net.

# Creating your own packages

Packages make the design, implementation, and maintenance of large software systems easier and simpler. Moreover, they allow multiple programmers to work on the same project without any overlapping. So, if you find yourselves using the same functions all the time, you should seriously consider including them in your own Go packages.

The source code of a Go package, which can contain multiple files, can be found within a single directory, which is named after the package with the exception of the main package, which can have any name.

The Go code of the aSimplePackage.go file, which will be developed in this section, will be presented in two parts.

The first part is the following:

```markup
package aSimplePackage 
 
import ( 
   "fmt" 
) 
```

There is nothing special here; you just have to define the name of the package and include the necessary import statements because a package can depend on other packages.

The second part contains the following Go code:

```markup
const Pi = "3.14159" 
 
func Add(x, y int) int { 
   return x + y 
} 
 
func Println(x int) { 
   fmt.Println(x) 
} 
```

So, the aSimplePackage package offers two functions and one constant.

After you finish writing the code of aSimplePackage.go, you should execute the following commands in order to be able to use the package in other Go programs or packages:

```markup
$ mkdir ~/go
$ mkdir ~/go/src
$ mkdir ~/go/src/aSimplePackage
$ export GOPATH=~/go
$ vi ~/go/src/aSimplePackage/aSimplePackage.go
$ go install aSimplePackage 
```

You should perform all these actions for every Go package you create, apart from the first two mkdir commands, which should only be executed once.

As you can see, each package needs its own directory inside ~/go/src. After executing the aforementioned commands, the go tool will automatically generate an ar(1) archive of the Go package you have just compiled in the pkg directory:

```markup
$ ls -lR ~/go
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 mtsouk  staff  102 Apr  4 22:35 pkg
drwxr-xr-x  3 mtsouk  staff  102 Apr  4 22:35 src
    
/Users/mtsouk/go/pkg:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 mtsouk  staff  102 Apr  4 22:35 darwin_amd64
    
/Users/mtsouk/go/pkg/darwin_amd64:
total 8
-rw-r--r--  1 mtsouk  staff  2918 Apr  4 22:35 aSimplePackage.a
    
/Users/mtsouk/go/src:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 mtsouk  staff  102 Apr  4 22:35 aSimplePackage
    
/Users/mtsouk/go/src/aSimplePackage:
total 8
-rw-r--r--  1 mtsouk  staff  148 Apr  4 22:30 aSimplePackage.go
```

Although you are now ready to use the aSimplePackage package, you cannot see the functionality of the package without having an autonomous program.

# Private variables and functions

Private variables and functions are different from public ones in that they can be used and called only internally in a package. Controlling which functions and variables are public or not is also known as encapsulation.

Go follows a simple rule which states that functions, variables, types, and so on that begin with an uppercase letter are public, whereas functions, variables, types, and so on that begin with a lowercase letter are private. However, this rule does not affect package names.

You should understand now why the fmt.Printf() function is named as it is, instead of fmt.printf().

To illustrate this, we will make some changes to the aSimplePackage.go module and add one private variable and one private function. The name of the new separate package will be anotherPackage.go. You can see the changes made to it using the diff(1) command-line utility:

```markup
$ diff aSimplePackage.go anotherPackage.go
1c1
<packageaSimplePackage
---
>packageanotherPackage
7a8
>const version = "1.1"
15a17,20
>
>func Version() {
>     fmt.Println("The version of the package is", version)
> }
```

# The init() function

Every Go package can have a function named init() that is automatically executed at the beginning of the execution. So, let's add the following init() function to the code of the anotherPackage.go package:

```markup
func init() { 
   fmt.Println("The init function of anotherPackage") 
} 
```

The current implementation of the init() function is naive and does nothing special. However, there are times when you want to perform important initializations before you start using a package such as opening database and network connections: in these relatively rare cases the init() function is invaluable.

# Using your own Go packages

This subsection will show you how to use the aSimplePackage and anotherPackage packages in your own Go programs by presenting two small Go programs named usePackage.go and privateFail.go.

In order to use the aSimplePackage package that resides under the GOPATH directory from another Go program, you will need to write the following Go code:

```markup
package main 
 
import ( 
   "aSimplePackage" 
   "fmt" 
) 
 
func main() { 
   temp := aSimplePackage.Add(5, 10) 
   fmt.Println(temp) 
   fmt.Println(aSimplePackage.Pi) 
} 
```

First of all, if aSimplePackage is not already compiled and located at the expected location, the compilation process will fail with an error message similar to the following:

```markup
$ go run usePackage.go
usePackage.go:4:2: cannot find package "aSimplePackage" in any of:
      /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.8/libexec/src/aSimplePackage (from $GOROOT)
      /Users/mtsouk/go/src/aSimplePackage (from $GOPATH)
```

However, if aSimplePackage is available, usePackage.go will be executed just fine:

```markup
$ go run usePackage.go
15
3.14159
```

Now, let's see the Go code of the other small program that uses anotherPackage:

```markup
package main 
 
import ( 
   "anotherPackage" 
   "fmt" 
) 
 
func main() { 
   anotherPackage.Version() 
   fmt.Println(anotherPackage.version) 
   fmt.Println(anotherPackage.Pi) 
} 
```

If you try to call a private function or use a private variable from anotherPackage, your Go program privateFail.go will fail to run with the following error message:

```markup
$ go run privateFail.go
# command-line-arguments
./privateFail.go:10: cannot refer to unexported name anotherPackage.version
./privateFail.go:10: undefined: anotherPackage.version
```

I really like showing error messages because most books try to hide them as if they were not there. When I was learning Go, it took me about 3 hours of debugging until I found that the reason for an error message I could not explain was the name of a variable!

However, if you remove the call to the private variable from privateFail.go, the program will be executed without errors. Additionally, you will see that the init() function actually gets executed automatically:

```markup
$ go run privateFail.go
The init function of anotherPackage
The version of the package is 1.1
3.14159
```

# Using external Go packages

Sometimes packages are available on the internet and you would prefer to use them by specifying their internet address. One such example is the Go MySQL driver that can be found at github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql.

Look at the following Go code, which is saved as useMySQL.go:

```markup
package main 
 
import ( 
   "fmt" 
   _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql") 
 
func main() { 
   fmt.Println("Using the MySQL Go driver!") 
} 
```

The use of \_ as the package identifier will make the compiler ignore the fact that the package is not being used: the only sensible reason for bypassing the compiler is when you have an init function in your unused package that you want to be executed. The other sensible reason is for illustrating a Go concept!

If you try to execute useMySQL.go, the compilation process will fail:

```markup
$ go run useMySQL.go
useMySQL.go:5:2: cannot find package "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" in any of:
      /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.8/libexec/src/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql (from $GOROOT)
      /Users/mtsouk/go/src/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql (from $GOPATH)
```

In order to compile useMySQL.go, you should first perform the following steps:

```markup
$ go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
$ go run useMySQL.go
Using the MySQL Go driver!
```

After successfully downloading the required package, the contents of the ~/go directory verify that the desired Go package has been downloaded:

```markup
$ ls -lR ~/go

# The go clean command

There will be times when you are developing a big Go program that uses lots of nonstandard Go packages and you want to start the compilation process from the beginning. Go allows you to clean up the files of a package in order to recreate it later. The following command cleans up a package without affecting the code of the package:

```markup
$ go clean -x -i aSimplePackage
cd /Users/mtsouk/go/src/aSimplePackage
rm -f aSimplePackage.test aSimplePackage.test.exe
rm -f /Users/mtsouk/go/pkg/darwin_amd64/aSimplePackage.a
```

Similarly, you can also clean up a package that you have downloaded from the internet, which also requires the use of its full path:

```markup
$ go clean -x -i github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
cd /Users/mtsouk/go/src/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
rm -f mysql.test mysql.test.exe appengine appengine.exe
rm -f /Users/mtsouk/go/pkg/darwin_amd64/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql.a
```

Please note that the go clean command is also particularly useful when you want to transfer your projects to another machine without including unnecessary files.

# Garbage collection

In this section, we will briefly talk about how Go deals with GC, which tries to free unused memory efficiently. The Go code of garbageCol.go can be presented in two parts.

The first part is as follows:

```markup
package main 
 
import ( 
   "fmt" 
   "runtime" 
   "time" 
) 
 
func printStats(mem runtime.MemStats) { 
   runtime.ReadMemStats(&mem) 
   fmt.Println("mem.Alloc:", mem.Alloc) 
   fmt.Println("mem.TotalAlloc:", mem.TotalAlloc) 
   fmt.Println("mem.HeapAlloc:", mem.HeapAlloc) 
   fmt.Println("mem.NumGC:", mem.NumGC) 
   fmt.Println("-----") 
} 
```

Every time you want to read the latest memory statistics, you should make a call to the runtime.ReadMemStats() function.

The second part, which contains the implementation of the main() function, has the following Go code:

```markup
func main() { 
   var memruntime.MemStats 
   printStats(mem) 
 
   for i := 0; i< 10; i++ { 
         s := make([]byte, 100000000) 
         if s == nil { 
               fmt.Println("Operation failed!") 
         } 
   } 
   printStats(mem) 
 
   for i := 0; i< 10; i++ { 
         s := make([]byte, 100000000) 
         if s == nil { 
               fmt.Println("Operation failed!") 
         } 
         time.Sleep(5 * time.Second) 
   } 
   printStats(mem) 
} 
```

Here, you try to obtain large amounts of memory in order to trigger the use of the garbage collector.

Executing garbageCol.go generates the following output:

```markup
$ go run garbageCol.go
mem.Alloc: 53944
mem.TotalAlloc: 53944
mem.HeapAlloc: 53944
mem.NumGC: 0
-----
mem.Alloc: 100071680
mem.TotalAlloc: 1000146400
mem.HeapAlloc: 100071680
mem.NumGC: 10
-----
mem.Alloc: 66152
mem.TotalAlloc: 2000230496
mem.HeapAlloc: 66152
mem.NumGC: 20-----
```

So, the output presents information about properties related to the memory used by the garbageCol.go program. If you want to get an even more detailed output, you can execute garbageCol.go, as shown here:

```markup
$ GODEBUG=gctrace=1 go run garbageCol.go
```

This version of the command will give you information in the following format:

```markup
gc 11 @0.101s 0%: 0.003+0.083+0.020 ms clock, 0.030+0.059/0.033/0.006+0.16 mscpu, 95->95->0 MB, 96 MB goal, 8 P
```

The 95->95->0 MB part contains information about the various heap sizes that also show how well or how badly the garbage collector is doing. The first value is the heap size when the GC starts, whereas the middle value shows the heap size when the GC ends. The third value is the size of the live heap.

# Your environment

In this section, we will show how to find out things about your environment using the runtime package: this can be useful when you have to take certain actions depending on the OS and the Go version you are using.

The use of the runtime package for finding out about your environment is straightforward and is illustrated in runTime.go:

```markup
package main 
 
import ( 
   "fmt" 
   "runtime" 
) 
 
func main() { 
   fmt.Print("You are using ", runtime.Compiler, " ") 
   fmt.Println("on a", runtime.GOARCH, "machine") 
   fmt.Println("with Go version", runtime.Version()) 
   fmt.Println("Number of Goroutines:", runtime.NumGoroutine())
} 
```

As long as you know what you want to call from the runtime package, you can get the information you desire. The last fmt.Println() command here displays information about **goroutines**: you will learn more about goroutines in [Chapter 9](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/programming/9781787125643/9)_,_ _Goroutines - Basic Features_.

Executing runTime.go on a macOS machine generates the following output:

```markup
$ go run runTime.go
You are using gc on a amd64 machine
with Go version go1.8
Number of Goroutines: 1  
```

Executing runTime.go on a Linux machine that uses an older Go version gives the following:

```markup
$ go run runTime.go
You are using gc on a amd64 machine
with Go version go1.3.3
Number of Goroutines: 4
```

# Go gets updated frequently!

As I came to the end of writing this chapter, Go was updated a little. So, I decided to include this information in this book in order to give a better sense of how often Go gets updated:

```markup
$ date
Sat Apr  8 09:16:46 EEST 2017
$ go version
go version go1.8.1 darwin/amd64
```

# Exercises

1.  Visit the documentation of the runtime package.
2.  Create your own structure, make a slice and use the sort.Slice() to sort the elements of the slice you created.
3.  Implement the quicksort algorithm in Go and sort some randomly-generated numeric data.
4.  Implement a doubly linked list.
5.  The implementation of tree.go is far from complete! Try to implement a function that checks whether a value can be found in the tree and another function that allows you to delete a tree node.
6.  Similarly, the implementation of the linkedList.go file is also incomplete. Try to implement a function for deleting a node and another one for inserting a node somewhere inside the linked list.
7.  Once again, the hash table implementation of hash.go is incomplete as it allows duplicate entries. So, implement a function that searches the hash table for a key before inserting it.

# Summary

In this chapter, you learned many things related to algorithms and data structures. You also learned how to use existing Go packages and how to develop your own Go packages. This chapter also talked about garbage collection in Go and how to find information about your environment.

In the next chapter, we will start talking about systems programming and present even more Go code. More precisely, [](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/programming/9781787125643/5)[Chapter 5](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/programming/9781787125643/5), _Files and Directories_, will talk about how to work with files and directories in Go, how to painlessly traverse directory structures, and how to process command-line arguments using the flag package. But more importantly, we will start developing Go versions of various Unix command-line utilities.
